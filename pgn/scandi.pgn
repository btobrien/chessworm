popular continuation; however, as compared to the corresponding position after

turn her attention to opening the e-file with 7...Qe7!. You can skip straight

{Sergei Krivoshey is not a name many chess players are familiar with, although
the Ukrainian GM has amassed an impressive array of scalps with his unorthodox
play. Perhaps no other grandmaster has contributed as much to the theory of
our opening over the past fifteen years. This game, one of Krivoshey's early
efforts, neatly encompasses his uncompromisingly entertaining style.} 1. e4 d5

drum up substantial attacking chances or create weaknesses within the opposing

many moves in this position, the most popular being 12...Ne5 and 12...Nc5.

almost as popular as 6...e6 in overall practice, although in recent years it
has lost a lot of its following. We won't be spending too much time discussing
this alternative as I am confident of Black's chances in the main line after 6.
..e6. Nevertheless, there are several good reasons why you might prefer to
adopt this variation from time to time: It is straightforward, easy to
understand, and requires comparatively little theory to learn. The main idea
of playing for a quick ...b7-b5 and sacrificing queenside pawns in Benko
Gambit style is visually appealing. Black plays to break up the white
structure as quickly as possible, aiming for compensation of a more positional
nature against the pawn weaknesses in White's camp. --- I have found some
interesting ideas that may resurrect the variation from Black's perspective.
Should you be interested in pursuing this further, the following analysis will
serve as a good base. From the diagram, White has an important choice, with
both alternatives scoring roughly the same in practice. I believe capturing
the knight to be White's strongest option, though both moves are seen equally
often.} 7. -- (7. Bxd7+ {(see variation B1)}) (7. Ba4 {(see variation B2)}) *

embarks on an energetic campaign with Qe2 and g2-g4, putting pressure on

whenever White is tempted into undertaking further operations with her
kingside pawns, we should always remember that her king will be susceptible in
the long run. So long as Black is prepared to meet White's immediate threats,
she can expect excellent counter-chances against the white monarch. A key idea
is that if White delays g2-g4 for too long, Black can often answer this thrust
with the surprising retreat ...Bf5-c8!, from where the bishop will both be
safe and find an active redeployment on b7. --- The white side of this
variation was championed by several Australian IMs from the fabulous city of
Melbourne, and so I have dutifully and affectionately named it 'the Melbourne
Shuffle' (a reference you may have to google). These lines can get incredibly
sharp for both sides, which is right up our alley. Most importantly, I believe
Black is holding her own theoretically as well as practically. So let the
dance commence!} *

{An important tabiya for this line. White's system may look harmless, but
don't be fooled: she is actually embarking on an extremely ambitious approach,
neglecting castling and positional considerations in an attempt to blow Black
out of the water. White is hoping to exploit Black's queenside extensions with
a quick a2-a4, targeting the pawn on b5 or preparing a4-a5 and Bb3-a4+.
Moreover, the f5-bishop often finds itself in trouble, either due to g2-g4,
Qe2 and f3-f4, or else Ng1-e2-g3 and f3-f4. In fact, quite often in the
Melbourne Shuffle, Black prefers to drop her bishop back to c8 when kicked.
(It is for this reason that White has often started with 6 g4 to force the
bishop back to g6 - though, as we've seen, this move-order has its own
problems.) --- The key to understanding this variation is to realize that, if
Black can survive the initial assault and complete her development, White's
early expansions will leave behind several, juicy, long-term weaknesses. So
long as Black can take care of both her queen's bishop and her queenside in
the short term (often achieved by ...Bf5-c8!), she can look to the middlegame
with promise.} 9. Nge2 ({Alternatively:} 9. g4 {can now be met by} Bc8 $1 {,

diagonals at their disposal, while White's knight on h5 is offside and her
kingside permanently weakened.}) *

1. e4 d5 2. exd5 Nf6 3. d4 Bg4 4. f3 Bf5 5. g4 $1 {If there is an absolute
refutation of 3 d4 Bg4, it must be this. White's outlandish approach has been
rarely seen in over-the-board practice; in fact, I have never faced this
variation in literally hundreds of games in this opening, and it is simply
omitted in most published texts on 3...Bg4. However, this system has been
successfully employed within the correspondence community, which speaks to its
merit. The variation's development was also furthered by FM Michiel Wind in
2008, who championed the white cause in the German chess magazine Kaissiber.
(My thanks go to the editor, Stefan Bücker, for providing me with a copy of
the magazine and also for useful comments.) --- Wind's analysis, coupled with
robust testing in subsequent correspondence games and my own extensive
analysis, has led me to conclude that this is by far the most serious threat
to the viability of the Portuguese complex. In fact, if computers ever manage
to solve the game of chess, I have a feeling that this line may well be
recorded as the ultimate refutation of 3...Bg4. --- Okay, I've painted a
rather bleak picture of Black's chances in that brutally honest introduction.
But before you ask your bookstore for a refund, let's look at the flipside of
the equation. First of all, like so many computer-inspired variations, the
strength of White's approach comes from precise, concrete lines, many of which
defy human logic. White's early g2-g4 thrust means that she is unlikely to be
able to castle safely, not just in the near future, but most probably not at
all. Additionally, at several branches of the analysis White will be forced to
neglect her development further in order to justify her greed; in some cases,
White's first ten or more moves will all be pawn moves - and this will be
absolutely necessary in order for her to stay in the game! --- My point is
that White's extreme disregard for classical opening principles in the name of
grabbing material leaves her position hanging by a thread - although, with
best play, it does indeed appear to hold on. Black has several, attractive,
dangerous options at different moves, and while White's position seems to be
robust against each with best play, there are simply too many lines for a
human to memorize. Inaccuracies by Black lead to positions where she has
insufficient, but tricky, compensation. Inaccuracies by White are often fatal.
--- Keep this in mind as you go through the chapter. Remembering the
infrequency of this variation in tournament play, I would recommend not
spending too much time committing the analysis to memory; instead, it is more
important to simply be aware that the variation exists, and to familiarize
yourself with Black's common ideas. --- I don't want this to read as a
dismissal or an excuse; in correspondence chess, for example, I believe that
White's chances of winning with this variation are high, which is reflected by
its popularity in this genre. However, in an over-the-board human contest,
White has to overcome almost insurmountable practical difficulties in order to
keep her position together. Even if your opponent has spent several hours
delving into deep computer analysis, I can't imagine her being able to
memorize all of the variations necessary to nurse a theoretical advantage to
fruition - Black simply has too many possibilities that give her excellent
play and the typical 'almost-sufficient compensation'. --- From a practical
perspective, if I ever do face 5 g4, I am confident of being able to bamboozle
an opponent over the board in the crazy, razor-sharp tactics that emerge, in
which White really needs to walk on a knife's edge in order to keep an
advantage. On the other hand, Black's position sure is a lot more fun!} Bg6 (
5... Bd7 $5 {is covered in the theory and leads to less explored positions,
though objectively White can keep a sound advantage with precise play.}) 6. c4
$1 {In the few encounters featuring this variation, Black has usually
continued with 6...e6 and we will take this as the main line; however, the
rarely played 6...c6!? comes into consideration too (this option is in fact so
rare that one of our illustrative games is an all-engine match I ran on my
home computer!). Nevertheless, despite its infrequency in practice, the
Correspondence deserves our attention and careful study. Understand these
positions and you can feel confident that you will be better able to navigate
the murky waters than your opponents.} *

{It seems strange to include an engine match for illustration, but there are
simply no recorded games that demonstrate the critical variation. My
conclusion from lengthy analysis of 6...c6 is supported by several engine
simulations (such as this game) and by blitz matches between club-level
colleagues: White can maintain an advantage with extreme accuracy, but Black's
position is surprisingly resourceful and, I would argue, easier to play. This
is borne out by the fact that Stockfish managed to hold the draw against
itself in this classically-timed match. --- Bear in mind that, although engine
evaluations usually declare a healthy advantage for White in this line, the
positions are definitely far better suited to computers than to humans. For us
mistake-prone anthropoids, it is worth remembering that the consequences of
inaccuracy are far direr for White than Black here. I am aware that it sounds
like I am already offering excuses for the unsoundness of Black's position,
and to some extent that is true. But the point I'm trying to make is that we
should remember that our opening is typically designed to pressurize fallible
opponents, and so some degree of 'gambling' is practically acceptable. ---
Nonetheless, in the following engine battle, White doesn't have the excuse of
intimidation to explain the failure to secure the full point. It was quite an
interesting fight to observe from the comfort of my sofa: although White
naturally avoided all of the lurking tactical tricks, the resourcefulness of
Black's position was demonstrated time and again over the course of the
four-hour silicon contest. It is also somehow reassuring to discover that even
the world's strongest engines can still perform terribly in rook endgames!} 1.

Black has a couple of tricky alternatives on her sixth move. The first is an

'tested' this variation by getting my club-level colleagues to play blitz
matches against each other, and by running deep engine-vs-engine matches. The
results are surprisingly promising, and it may be that this line offers Black
the best practical chances against the Correspondence. I don't claim that
Black's sacrifice is objectively sound against accurate resistance, but
Black's position is somewhat easier to play and has a certain structural
justification. I realize this may sound like the ramblings of a desperate

already nicely lined up against the white king. Objectively, one cannot claim
full compensation for the pawn, but given that White would have had to show
impressive accuracy to reach a position in which Black still retains good
attacking chances, I think we should be satisfied with the outcome of the
opening.} *

1. e4 d5 2. exd5 Nf6 3. d4 Bg4 4. f3 Bf5 5. g4 Bg6 6. c4 e6 {White has made
six pawn moves in a row, and might well add a seventh. While this may seem
extraordinarily cheeky, White isn't that far behind in development; after all,
Black has moved her bishop three times already, and her f6-knight is about to
be kicked offside. --- From our perspective, White will usually try to blow us
off the board over the next few moves, fighting us with our own style as she
seemingly ignores positional considerations in favour of concrete tactics. The
knight on c3, combined with the coming g4-g5 thrust, ensures that she will
keep control over d5. The queen usually lines up against our king from e2,
while her own king can tuck in at f2 if necessarily. A kingside pawn storm is
often on the cards, while the kingside minor pieces usually swing in to the
game via the h3-square. All up, White's position contains a lot of hidden
attacking potential. --- If all of that has managed to scare you, well, that
was the intention! You should definitely not take White's set-up for granted.
But never fear; there is plenty of good news for the black side as well. For
the moment, at least, White hasn't got a single piece out from its starting
position, whereas Black is just two moves from castling. This is actually the
key trump in our hand: while the white king will have a hard time finding
long-term security, Black's will (usually) be safely tucked away for when the
fireworks start. --- While the main lines analysed by the correspondence
community have usually focused on Black's attempts to win back her pawn,
naturally, we will prefer to forego the material and play for maximum activity.
The only way to combat White's attempt at an outright refutation is to stand
up to the challenge and fight fire with fire. --- From the diagram, White has
a choice of move-orders, which will likely to lead to the same thing if Black
quickly takes on d5. However, Black has several good reasons to avoid this,
not least because White can often use an open e-file to her advantage. The
pawn on e6 is actually doing a good job at the moment, both blocking the
e-file from an annoying Qe2+ and controlling the f5-square against a quick
f4-f5 assault. Black may well break the tension on d5 at some point, but for
the moment, she should prefer to develop her king's bishop and quickly castle,
exploiting her lead in development to maximum effect. A key theme is meeting
Qb3 with the odd-looking counter ...c7-c5. In fact, even without provocation,
Black can often attack White's central pawn phalanx with this move to open up
some squares and lines for the black minor pieces. --- White's best move by
far is 7 Nc3, but first we will examine the alternatives. If you're looking
for quick memory-markers, my advice is: after 7 g5 Nfd7 8 Nc3, play 8...Be7!;
if White goes for 7 Nc3, play 7...c5! so as to answer 8 g5 with 8...cxd4!.} 7.

an explanation mark by Michiel Wind in Kaissiber, and deservedly so. After all,
White finally develops a piece! We enter an extremely complex and
underexplored structure, perfect conditions for a fighting player to thrive.
Black has several interesting possibilities, revolving around either swift
development or challenging White's pawn centre. For her part, White will have
to play accurately over the next few moves, and will often be forced to make
several more pawn moves (such as h2-h4 or g4-g5) in order to prevent Black's
minor pieces from becoming active, though if she manages to achieve this, she
has excellent chances of earning a decisive advantage. --- Other than Wind's
work, I have been unable to find any other published analysis on this line.
However, one can get an idea of the established theory by following the
historical progression of correspondence games in this variation. Here, too,
there are many improvements to be found. --- We will look at several options
for Black from the diagram, beginning with the 'main line' (if you can call it
that for such a limited body of theory), 7...exd5. Again, I would like to
stress that the chances of you ever getting even as far as the diagrammed
position are quite remote, so you should consider how best to use your
Scandinavian study time before delving deeply into the analysis that follows.}

at the previous lines, it is clear that Black is struggling to prove full
compensation against best play by White. Hence the need for a fresh, dynamic
counter-punch: 7...c5. This interesting move seeks to rattle White's pawn
centre and free up some squares for Black's minor pieces. The resulting
positions are both unusual and extremely complicated. From a practical
perspective, White has the tougher job, as one small slip could mean a swift
checkmate. Objectively, I cannot believe that Black's compensation is
sufficient with best play, but I am confident in Black's chances in an
over-the-board encounter, particularly at sub-grandmaster levels. --- To test
my theory, I ran a little chess experiment. I had two of my strong blitz
colleagues play a ten-game blitz match from this position with alternating
colours. Both players were taught the basic theory and then left to their own
devices. Black scored an impressive nine out of ten, confirming that White has
a much harder task keeping things together in this line. Of course, this isn't
a serious scientific test, but it gives you an idea of the practical chances
available to Black after 7...c5. --- Memorizing what follows is inadvisable

motifs and manoeuvres for both colours. Also, pay attention to the positions

clever switchback by the bishop, taking advantage of Black's hemmed-in queen,
dampens Black's short-term attacking chances. --- The attraction of 5 Be2 lies
in its simplicity: White heads for a small but stable advantage by immediately
returning the pawn, while significantly reducing Black's counterplay. While
this could never be deemed an outright refutation, it is certainly a powerful
practical choice for White, who more often than not is looking for a simple,
theory-free panacea to our weapon. --- At first, it might seem like White has
just wasted a tempo compared to the Wuss (4 Be2). However, things are not so
simple. In those variations Black recaptures the pawn on d5 with her queen,
which usually finds an active post on f5 or h5. Her knight will jump to c6,
where it will pressure d4, support ...e7-e5 and facilitate queenside castling.
--- By tempting the black knight to d7 first, White circumvents this natural
development. Black must now recapture on d5 with her king's knight, which will
invariably be forced to retreat back to f6 in any case. Moreover, the traffic
jam on the d-file will mean that Black has to evacuate the king to the
kingside and try to arrange her pieces in a somewhat cramped fashion on the
first three ranks. In fact, compared to 4 Be2, Black often finds herself
lacking in both space and time. --- Once again, I must confess that I have
tried to scare you into taking careful notice of this chapter. So, now to the
good news. As you might have already guessed, the resulting positions are
incredibly underexplored. With the exception of this book, there is
practically no theory on this variation, which is excellent news for two
important reasons: 1. You will be much better prepared to tackle the
subtleties of the game; and 2. White has to play extremely accurately to cause
us any problems. --- Furthermore, without compromising on quality, I have
chosen to focus our repertoire on lines involving pawn sacrifices, material
imbalances and complex, unorthodox structures. I have done this in order to
maximize the practical advantages of our familiarity with the variation, and
to give our opponents every opportunity to err. --- The bottom line is: Don't
feel disheartened if you see 5 Be2 on your board. With solid preparation and a
sensible approach, you should see your practical results flourish. We are
playing for fun and for fire, to balance risk and return. After all, that's
our philosophy, remember?} *

naked, so Black will have to compensate for this with piece activity, likely
offering up the little soldier. If White accepts the gift, the pawn sacrifice
gives Black a dangerous level of activity that extends into the endgame. ---

advise you to play through it. Every now and then in our repertoire,

key in such situations is not to get discouraged and try to lash out; Black's

suffocation. With careful manoeuvring, Black can slowly improve her set-up and
wait for the correct moment to strike. While this approach is more similar to

1. e4 d5 2. exd5 Nf6 3. d4 Bg4 4. Bb5+ c6 $5 {In an episode from the third
season of the fantastic television series The West Wing, Leo McGarry, the
Chief of Staff to the President of the United States, talks about the concept
of "throwing an elbow". He tells a story about legendary basketball centre
Bill Russell of the Boston Celtics. Russell was struggling against his
opposite numbers because he chose to play by the rules rather than 'play
dirty'. As Leo tells it: "Russell was getting eaten alive because they could
never get him to throw an elbow. He didn't want to do it. So, Coach Red
Auerbach told him to do it one time. 'Throw an elbow in a nationally televised
game. You'll never have to do it again.'" --- As much as I could go on and on
about The West Wing, there is a point. As I mentioned earlier, 4 Bb5+ Nbd7 5
Be2 is an incredibly rare variation, but that doesn't mean it won't grow in
popularity in the future - particularly because it could be seen as a nice,
safe, 'easy' way to get a small plus. And indeed, as we saw, White never faces
too many dangers and certainly doesn't have to learn much theory to stay out
of trouble in the main lines. --- Recently, the inventive Australian IM Guy
West, one of the country's first regular Scandinavian players, complained to
me that a few guys in his local club had started playing this variation
against him regularly, much to his annoyance. But he didn't want to resort to
4...c6 because he thought it was fundamentally unsound - which is possibly
true. --- I wrote back and told him to "throw an elbow". As we saw, Black has
good chances of equalizing against 4...Nbd7 5 Be2, but it's a tough line to
drum up winning chances. However, 4...c6!? leads to far more complicated
positions where Black's pieces quickly reach active posts, and against which
White must play accurately not only to keep an advantage, but even to stay out
of trouble. There's theory to learn, and the positions aren't going to suit
players looking for a calmer game. And even if White manages to navigate the
murky opening swamp, the resulting endgames seem to give Black just enough
compensation to take half a point - at least, my engines consistently make
draws in the many simulations I've run. --- The point is that an opponent is
far less likely to play 4 Bb5+ if she knows she has to learn the theory on yet
another crazy sacrifice after 4...c6!? - that is, if you've developed a
reputation by "throwing an elbow" in this line before. Not only is it a great
surprise weapon - Black scores 60% with it in over-the-board play, and even
higher in blitz - it is likely going to be off-putting for future opponents.
--- So even if you don't believe in the soundness of what follows, I suggest
you add it to the memory bank, and throw it out there once in a while. It
might pay dividends not only as a surprise weapon, but also as a useful
deterrent!} 5. dxc6 Nxc6 {At first, it is hard to believe Black can drum up
sufficient attacking chances against the white position. But Black's
compensation manifests itself a little more subtly in this variation. She
usually obtains the bishop pair after White plays Bxc6 (and sometimes even
Bg5xf6), and can seek to exploit this by eventually opening up the game
through ...e7/e6-e5 or ...c6-c5 breaks. --- Meanwhile, White often finds it
difficult to coordinate her pieces due to pressure on the d4-, c2-and b2-pawns.
The pin on the f3-knight can also be very annoying, and attempts to break it
with h2-h3 and g2-g4 often lead to disaster after Black sacrifices with ...
Nxg4. While there are no obvious attacking motifs, Black often enjoys full or
almost-full compensation, active pieces, and easy play.} *

hand-waving on your author's part, I suggest you run this position on your
computer for a while and let it guide your opinion. Chances are it will tell
you something in the range of +0.3 to +0.4. --- Checked it? Good. Now, allow
me to give you some intuition behind the source of Black's compensation. Front
and centre, of course, is White's weakened kingside pawn structure. It is hard
to see her ever eliminating the weaknesses, as Black can always set up an h5/
g6/f7/e6 pawn blockade. More importantly, however, is the weakness of White's
isolated h-pawn. In fact, it is so weak that White can often fall worse if all
the rooks are exchanged and Black can attack the pawn with ...Bg7-e5 and ...
Nh5-f4. --- More immediate concerns for White are her loose bishop on a7 and
knight on c3, which is soon to be pinned to the b2-pawn via Black's ...Bg7. If
she decides to do nothing, Black can often play ...Bxc3 to create another set
of pawn weaknesses - after which, again, White has to be careful not to drift
into an inferior position, despite her extra pawn. --- So, as you can see,
things aren't as simple as they first appear. Again, I should stress that,
objectively, White is better here. However, if you study this chapter
carefully and get a deep understanding of this endgame, you can ensure that
you are the better prepared player should these positions ever arise on your
board. If you do this, you can be confident of at least holding the draw, and
perhaps feel optimistic that, if your opponent plays carelessly, you might be
able to snatch the whole point. --- A plausible continuation could be:} 14. Ke2

after 7 Nc3, each side has an extra pawn (on d4 and a7, respectively), though

attention, and it is consequently more difficult for White to find a
harmonious deployment of her minor pieces. --- Of course, only White can be
objectively better in this position, which is a practical problem for our

4. Nf3 Qxd5 {It is often employed by opponents who, when surprised by 3...Bg4,
take the attitude, "Surely simple development can't be wrong." On the contrary,
Black can quickly whip up dangerous pressure on the d4-pawn with ...Nc6, ...
0-0-0 and ...e7-e5 (usually after swinging the queen to the kingside). ---
Given that the kings will be castled on opposite wings, it should come as no
surprise that Black can plan a rapid attack against the white monarch. When
the black queen is eventually persuaded to relocate (after Nc3 or c2-c4, or
even voluntarily), she often chooses between h5 and f5. Clearly h5 is the more
aggressive post, but it should be noted that Black is then committed to
answering h2-h3 with a piece sacrifice by playing a quick ...e7-e5!. Such
sacrifices don't tend to work with the queen on f5; from here, Black can
answer h2-h3 with ...Bxf3 and usually ...e7-e5 anyway. As a general rule of
thumb, f5 is your default square after c2-c4 or if you need to move it
voluntarily, while Nc3 can usually be answered by ...Qh5. Another way of
looking at it is that f5 is generally always a safe choice for your queen,
even after Nc3. --- I have an excellent score in the Classical, perhaps the
highest out of all variations in our system. In my experience, the Wuss and
the Classical are the two anti-Portuguese variations in which you will
encounter the greatest number of opponents who don't know the theory and are
simply looking for a safe way to escape the opening. In the Classical, however,
this is a very dubious strategy. Rather than a safe choice, this variation
demands precision and theoretical preparedness from White in order to stay
afloat. Become familiar with the traps and tricks in the lines that follow,
and you will be able to score yourself many, many easy points. --- It should
be noted that the Classical variation often transposes to either the 2...Qxd5
Scandinavian or the Nimzowitsch Defence (1 e4 Nc6), although there are some
differences in our system as Black has already committed to ...Nf6. This means
there is a small percentage of players who are familiar with the white side of
things from other systems, and therefore may be well versed in the intricacies
of the Classical. I faced such an opponent in our first illustrative game. My
point is that you shouldn't automatically assume that you are facing a
theoretically naive opponent just because they play in this fashion, even if
the chances of this at club levels are statistically high. --- What follows
may seem like a mass of cross-references and variations, but don't worry: the
actual material required by Black to master this line is quite moderate. Many
of the variations transpose, depending on White's chosen move-order, and
rarely does the exact sequence affect Black's standard plan of ...Nc6, ...
0-0-0, ...Qh5/f5 and ...e7-e5. I have tried to be as thorough as possible with
detailing all likely move-orders, but this is more for your personal reference
than a request to memorize each line. --- But before we wade into the jungle,
let's again ease ourselves in by looking at some model games.} *

has a huge mass of transpositions within its lines; but don't let this put you
off. Rather, you should see it as an advantage, because you are far more
likely to be familiar with the theory than your opponents, and therefore the
chances of catching them out in an opening trap aren't bad at all. The main
theme to remember is being aware of the pressure on d4, which can often be
exploited by tactical means.} 7. O-O (7. Nc3 $6 Qf5 $1 {already favours Black.}

come to the end of our discussion of 3 d4, which you will encounter more often
than not at White's third move. This is by far the largest and most diverse
section in the book; I haven't called it a "complex" for nothing! Still, there
is a large crossover of common ideas and motifs for both sides throughout the
variations, so there are definitely some synergies to be earned from a close
study. --- As we have seen, 3...Bg4 often leads to wild, sharp positions in
which the chances of catching out your opponent with a sneaky tactical trap,
or winning a dazzling attacking miniature, are very real. Much enjoyment and
excitement is to be had, which is why so many of us have succumbed to the
charms of this seductive opening. --- White's choice of variation after 3 d4
Bg4 can also signal some useful information about your opponent's theoretical
preparedness. Generally speaking, players who choose the Wuss, the Lusophobe,
or (surprisingly enough) the Banker are unlikely to have come to the board
armed with a deep knowledge of the theory. If White instead employs the Jadoul,
the Melbourne Shuffle or, especially, the Correspondence Refutation, you
should be on your guard. These are generally the choices of someone who has
either learned their book lines (which, as we have seen, is not necessarily a
scary thing for us), or who has directly prepared for your encounter. As for
players who whip out the Classical: from my experience, it's a bit of a mixed
bag. --- Of course, all of this should be taken with a grain of salt, as
bluffs (and double-bluffs!) are always a possibility. As a general rule,
however, I have found that this holds in most cases. Regardless, if you have
taken the time to study this section thoroughly, you should feel very
optimistic that your knowledge of the complex is greater than that of your
opponent. Remember the critical lines of the theory, put your pieces on their
normal squares and always keep in mind the standard ideas in each variation,
and you can be confident of chalking up some fine victories.}) *

1. e4 d5 2. exd5 Nf6 3. c4 {The principled 3 c4 was once a reasonably popular
means of meeting the 2...Nf6 Scandinavian, particularly as it was thought to
force a transposition to the formerly-fashionable Panov-Botvinnik Attack of
the Caro-Kann Defence after 3...c6 4 d4. The decline in popularity of 3 c4 is
due to two important theoretical developments. Firstly, the Panov-Botvinnik
Attack is no longer considered one of White's critical attempts at an
advantage against the Caro-Kann, with Black having done a good job at refining
her defensive strategies over the past few decades. Secondly, and no less
importantly, the discovery of the so-called Icelandic Gambit, which is
introduced by 3...e6, put many white players off the trail. This gambit (which
should more appropriately be named the Palme Gambit, after its inventor, the
Austrian master Rudolf Palme) gives Black splendid activity and very real
chances of scoring quick victories in tournament play. --- In modern times, it
seems that 3 c4 is seen as only inviting Black to make a pleasant choice
between adopting a rock-solid transposition to an acceptable variation of the
Caro-Kann, or unleashing a venomous gambit. Gradually, 3 c4 has slipped down
the list of White's frequent third-move alternatives, now sitting behind 3 Nf3,
3 Bb5+ and even 3 Nc3, as well as the still hugely popular main line 3 d4.
Despite that, there are good reasons to take 3 c4 seriously. Stylistically,
the main lines of the Panov-Botvinnik Attack generally require Black to defend
quite passively, usually playing prosaically against a white isolated queen's
pawn. On the other hand, the 'accepted' main line of the Icelandic Gambit
clearly seems to favour White after accurate play. Bearing this in mind,
practically speaking, a player comfortable with the transposition to the
Panov-Botvinnik would be advised to consider adopting 3 c4 as their first
choice. --- Nevertheless, the message in these chapters is quite positive from
Black's perspective. First, an important improvement in the main line of the
Icelandic Gambit (7...Bf5!) resurrects this exciting variation. Secondly,
Black has the option (after 3...c6) to wield a dangerous sideline in the
Panov-Botvinnik that comes complete with surprise value, pawn sacrifices and
quick, daring attacks against the white king. I have included my analysis on
both options (3...e6 and 3...c6) so that you can pick and choose your poison
according to your tastes and the demands of each situation.} *

Bc5 (if d2-d4 can be prevented) or ...Bb4 (in response to d2-d4). Also, with
both kings exposed on the newly-opened e-file, Black often opts to throw in a
quick ...Qe7 beforehand in order to disrupt White's coordination.  White has
plenty of chances to go wrong in this gambit, but with a precise sequence of
moves, she is reckoned to be able to neutralize Black's pressure and begin to
capitalize on the extra material. Fortunately, Black can eschew the
theoretical main line with the important improvement 7...Bf5!, leading to an
endgame in which her compensation seems to be sufficient. This will be the
subject of our first illustrative game:} *

{At the 2004 World Junior Championships in Kochin, India, I was assigned to
share a room with the representative from Uzbekistan: an exuberant,
thickly-accented sixteen-year-old by the name of Timur Gareyev. One couldn't
help but be immediately attracted to his charming eccentricities and his
unflappably positive attitude. It was during this event that I first really
tested out the 3...Bg4 Scandinavian against quality opposition, repeating the
opening four times in the tournament. The opening held up well, and I scored a
crushing victory over Filipino GM Mark Paragua (see Game 3 in the Jadoul
chapter of Section One) and made an important draw with Erwin L'Ami, who would
later go on to become one of the top grandmasters in the Netherlands. ---
Timur, being present at both my morning preparation and poolside post-mortem
sessions, asked many questions about "dis crayzee beeshop jee-four gambit",
and we had a lot of fun analysing the positions during our Indian fortnight as
roommates. Later on, I discovered that Timur had taken up the opening (in
addition to cross-country motorbike riding, skydiving and breaking world
blindfold chess records - but those are other stories). In this game, Timur,
by now a strong grandmaster, shows a deep understanding of Black's endgame
compensation in the Icelandic Gambit, playing it in a mature manner.} 1. e4 d5

An extremely rare move in practice, but it offers Black the best chances. I
had been waiting for several years for an opponent to allow me to unleash my
analysis on this move, when my attention was brought to a 2008 article by
Michiel Wind in the German magazine Kaissiber. His excellent analysis
supported my conclusions about 7...Bf5, and yet this line is still played only
infrequently today - perhaps because Wind's article was never translated into
English. In any case, there seems little doubt that the Icelandic Gambit's
reputation depends on the evaluation of the lines that follows this move. ---
As compared to 7...Bg4, White no longer has time to develop with Be3. On the
other hand, the exchange of queens is now more favourable for White, which she
can initiate immediately or after further preparation.} 8. Qxe7+ ({Instead:} 8.

{Black's compensation in the endgame lies in her superior development. Her
minor pieces are already mobilized and she is ready to launch active
operations against the white position. The vulnerable light-squared weaknesses
in the white queenside (namely c2, and potentially b3 if White plays a2-a3)
are attractive targets, while her extra pawn on d4 will quickly come under
attack. However, it is important to remember that these advantages are largely
temporary in nature, so Black must strive to play energetically to make use of
these trumps before White has time to consolidate. If Black does so, she will
discover that her compensation is worth at least a pawn, even without the
queens on the board.} 9. a3 ({We looked at} 9. Be3 Nb4 10. Na3 {in the game

the pawn, her d-pawn is more of a weakness than a strength, and White can
begin to mass her forces around it while pushing forward on the queenside.

1. e4 d5 2. exd5 Nf6 3. c4 c6 {As opposed to 3...e6, accepting the gambit
after 3...c6 is not considered White's best option. There are two reasons for
this. The first is because Black is effectively one move faster with her
development after 4 dxc6 Nxc6, as her light-squared bishop will reach an
active location on f5 or g4 in one move rather than (after 3...e6 4 dxe6 Bxe6)
in two. The second reason is that, after 3...c6 4 dxc6, Black can follow up
with a quick ...e7-e5, immediately controlling or challenging the centre.  On
the other hand, declining the gambit with 3...c6 4 d4 now makes a lot more
sense. The transposition to the Caro-Kann's Panov-Botvinnik Attack typically
leads to positions where White has an isolated queen's pawn, strikingly
similar to those often reached from a Nimzo-Indian Defence or even a Queen's
Gambit Accepted. These lines are sound and perfectly acceptable for Black from
a theoretical perspective, but they lack a certain panache for players whose
heart is set on the sort of excitement we've seen after 3 d4 Bg4. Therefore,
we will investigate an interesting sideline of the Panov-Botvinnik that is
more, shall we say, 'stylistically appropriate'.} *

move has a very respectable theoretical reputation as well, having been
frequently employed by such heavyweights as Morozevich, Kamsky and Grischuk.

opponents out of their theoretical knowledge, but more importantly, it seems
to offer Black good objective chances as well. Her multipurpose move gains
some space on the queenside before developing the knight to a6, from where the

Brussels Zonal 1993. --- This raises an important point worth mentioning about
3 Nf3. It is seen nowhere near as often as the main move 3 d4, largely because
it allows Black a reasonably favourable transposition to the 'normal'
Scandinavian after 3...Qxd5 4 Nc3 Qa5, while cutting out popular sidelines
that either delay Nf3 or omit it all together. (The same cannot be said if
Black chooses to transpose to other Scandinavian variations via 4...Qd6 or 3...
Nxd5, in which White invariably plays an early Nf3.) Several strong players
have chosen to add a second Scandinavian system to their overall black
repertoire for this very reason. --- On the other hand, I personally believe
that the lines I have presented below are perfectly acceptable for Black, and
so we now move to the main dish of this section: 3...Bg4. --- I have named the
(previously unnamed) subvariations with a particular culinary flair. My
apologies in advance for this, but a chess author has to have a bit of fun
every now and then. There are three key differences that White can try to
exploit after the consistent 3...Bg4. --- To begin with, White can utilize the
extra tempo from delaying d2-d4 by playing 4 c4, followed by a quick Qb3,
protecting d5 and targeting b7. Essentially, she is attempting to transpose
into positions similar to sharp lines of the Panov-Botvinnik Caro-Kann, having
arguably saved a tempo by delaying d2-d4. This approach is quite rare in
practice but was the recipe recommended by some friends of mine, who are noted
Hungarian theoreticians. I've cooked up our own secret antidote to their
'Goulash'. --- Second, note that White's third move puts her one move closer
to castling kingside (as compared with 3 d4). Thus, she can try to play in
classical fashion via 4 Be2 and a quick 0-0 and h2-h3 before Black has had
time to organize the standard counterplay using the d4- and e5-squares. In
such positions, Black rarely wants to retreat her bishop to h5, where it
deprives the black queen of an important square, and so an early exchange on
f3 is likely to be necessary. I then propose that we play ...Nc6, allowing an
ugly doubling of our c-pawns. Ugly doesn't necessarily mean unwholesome,
however, and I have full confidence that you will find my beloved 'Celeriac'
very good for your health. --- Finally, and most importantly, White can follow
up 3 Nf3 Bg4 with 4 Bb5+. Here, the Elbow-like 4...c6?! fails to deliver
sufficient compensation, while after the natural 4...Nbd7, White has the
powerful intermezzo 5 h3!. This line is rarely played in practice, but it has
been suggested in a couple of published books in recent years as a simple
recipe to gain an easy advantage against our opening - the perfect choice for
many players, such as my friend Charlie. I imagine that this variation's
popularity will increase in the future. In fact 5 h3 presents one of the
biggest challenges to our repertoire, but we will see that with careful play
and the help of some home-cooked analysis, Black can secure decent chances.
--- But first of all, a couple of quick appetizers to give this section some
flavour.} *

1. e4 d5 2. exd5 Nf6 3. Nf3 Bg4 {The day before, I had secured my third and
final Grandmaster norm, irrespective of the result of this game. With the
pressure off, it was time to have some fun, and so it is no surprise that 3...
Bg4 appeared on the board. Plus, I had a new idea I was aching to try out...}
4. Be2 Qxd5 5. Nc3 Qf5 $1 6. h3 {One of the key points of delaying d2-d4.
White immediately seeks to break the pin on f3, and in so doing hopes to
complete the development phase before Black can build up pressure in the
centre via ...Nc6 and ...0-0-0. However...} Bxf3 7. Bxf3 Nc6 $1 {A new idea.
It takes a certain aesthetic blindness to come up with such an ugly move, as
my colleagues were quick to remind me after the game. However, to quote
Christina Aguilera, 'You are beautiful, no matter what they say.' (Yes, I have
rather eclectic music tastes.)} 8. Bxc6+ bxc6 {Chess is so simple: You put
your king on d7 (but of course), a bishop on d6, a rook on g8, and then just
push your g-pawn down the board and deliver mate. Easy. --- Okay, I jest - if
only a little. There was a time when the masters would laugh at such a crude
structure, but the days of isolated, doubled pawns being considered a fatal
weakness are long gone. In modern chess, dynamic considerations and concrete
variations often outweigh the Nimzowitschian evaluation of positional elements.
This is one such case. --- Despite my postmodern standpoint on chess analysis,
it is still possible to explain my faith in Black's position in more familiar,
classical terms. For starters, the black king will be surprisingly safe on d7,
where the doubled c-pawns will actually provide a handy barrier against
unwelcome invasions. Combined with a pawn on e6, bishop on d6, and knight on
the excellent semi-outpost on d5, the black king can hardly be called exposed.
Moreover, all of Black's pieces will soon become more active than their
counterparts; the rooks will have important roles to play along the semi-open
b-file and (soon to be) semi-open g-file. This puts the white king in quite a
predicament, because it is clear that, whichever side of the board he chooses
to hide, an attack is imminent. --- I have scored 100% from the diagram in
several encounters since this game (usually in blitz, to be fair), and
experience has taught me that White's position is by no means easy to defend.
Black's attacking plan is straightforward and surprisingly fast. Moreover,
there's something deliciously cheeky about the entire set-up that I must
confess gives me an extra kick, especially after the inevitable ...Kd7!.} 9.

11. Qc4 Kd7 $5 {As the saying goes, "Weak pawns are only weak if they can be
attacked." Here, Black's pawns are easily defended. Black's position is
actually quite healthy: all of her pieces are superior to their opposite
numbers, and Black's king is no less secure than White's monarch. Normal moves
in the middlegame are ...Rb8, ...g7-g5 (often prepared by ...Rg8) and ...Nd5,
from where the knight can jump to f4. White has to act quickly.} ({

White's potential advances is in order. --- In summary, White is slightly
better, but with a little patience Black should be able to equalize in short
time. Objectively, a hypothetical match between two deities will most likely
end in a draw. With all of the pieces still on the board, there is plenty of

6... Bxf3 7. Bxf3 Nc6 $1 {When I first showed my idea to my long-time friend
and Australian Olympiad captain, Manuel Weeks, he exclaimed: "What an ugly
move!" I expect many people would feel similarly on seeing this for the first
time. However, in a sense this is a very logical continuation. White has
achieved the bishop pair, but Black has a lead in development and attacking
ambitions on the kingside. Consequently, Black is happy to offer a weakening
of her pawn structure in exchange for removing one of White's key kingside
defenders, as well as eliminating one of her bishops. Furthermore, after such
an exchange, Black will have a useful post for her knight on d5, from where an
exchange of knights would correct Black's structure anyway. Finally, perhaps
the most surprising advantage of the doubled black pawns on the c-file is that
they will offer the black king some valuable protection in his new home on -
wait for it - d7! --- This line could actually occur quite often in practice
through various move-orders, and given that Black's opening concept is so
original, I felt that it deserved its own name. When Manuel's wife
serendipitously exclaimed "What an ugly vegetable!" upon seeing celeriac for
the first time, I had my answer.} 8. Bxc6+ {White can delay (or omit) the

several times in blitz, with a 100% record; Black's attack almost plays itself.
She plans a quick sprint with her g-pawn to lever open the white kingside,
supported by ...Rhg8. Her queen's rook is comfortably placed on b8, where it
holds up the white queenside and can also swing into the game via b4 on
occasion. --- Black's doubled c-pawns may look ugly to some, but beauty is in
the eye of the beholder, and personally I find them beautiful! They are hardly
a weakness in this middlegame; in fact the cheeky little guys serve a very
useful defensive role in front of Black's king, which most often finds himself
on the surprisingly secure d7-square. On the other hand, kingside castling is
absolutely an acceptable, if less bloodthirsty, option. All in all, I believe

is a simple creature who prefers his openings like he prefers his food: simple,
solid and safe, while requiring little preparation. When he asked me for the
best no-nonsense approach against my own opening, I didn't hesitate in
recommending 5 h3. Charlie was happy. --- This innocent-looking move is in
fact a serious attempt at a refutation. This is an inconvenient moment for
Black to have to decide what to do with her bishop on g4. In general, as you
should know by now, Black primarily answers h2-h3 with ...Bxf3, followed
immediately by capturing on d5. However, here White can take advantage of the
omission of d2-d4 to secure the d5-pawn, leaving Black bereft of counterplay.
On the other hand, retreating the bishop to h5 will leave Black's queen
exposed when she eventually lands on d5, as her usual h5- and f5-squares are
no longer realistically available. The consequence of this quandary is that
White can aim for positions that are comfortable, simple and relatively safe -
a perfect choice for Charlie. --- The position after 5 h3 is, from the
perspective of our repertoire, quite rare. Nonetheless, I consider it to be
one of White's best ways of responding to 3...Bg4. Furthermore, it has been
recommended by some highly-regarded chess authors, such as GM John Emms, GM
Larry Kaufman and IM Andrew Greet, so Black should definitely be prepared to
handle this variation. These authors give Black's position a very negative
prognosis, but I will argue that things are not as bad as they seem; in fact,
equipped with a good understanding of this variation, Black should be able to
hold her own, even if the lines aren't as fun as those in other parts of this
book. --- I consider 5...Bh5! to be Black's best option, but it is worth
looking at the alternatives to see why Black's position is so fragile after
other moves. Also, you may decide that you don't like the slightly more
passive nature of the positions after 5...Bh5 and would prefer to roll the
dice with a riskier variation. Consequently, we will also take a closer look
at 5...a6!?. While being objectively inferior, this move does offer more

been seen a handful of times in tournament practice. So why should we spend
time on it? Because, as we have seen, Black has no satisfying way to deviate
from the variation leading from 3 Nf3 Bg4 to this important position.
Furthermore, it is the one issue that leads me to conclude that 3 Nf3 Bg4 is
somewhat inferior for Black as compared with 3 d4 Bg4. In particular, while I
believe Black's position is sound, it is difficult for her to drum up winning
chances if White just holds the fort, something that is very much not the case
in many of the other variations we have analysed. I suspect we may see an
increase in popularity for this line in the future. --- I have painted a
fairly negative picture, but I promise it's not all bad news! Previous
analysts have evaluated this position as being either slightly or clearly
better for White, and certainly I must concede that White's position is
optically more pleasant. She has more space, a slight lead in development, and
will soon put pressure on the centre. However, after looking deeper, it
gradually becomes clear that Black's game is exceptionally solid and, after
completing her development, she will be well prepared to meet White's advances.
--- After many hours studying this position, my conclusion is that it is
objectively equal. In a match between two supreme error-free deities, the game
will end in a draw. I have tested my hypothesis in many, many lengthy training
games between the world's top computer engines, and indeed, our esteemed
silicon friends always end up splitting the point. --- Of course, it is
important to remember that White has the 'easier' game. But of equally
important note is that our opponents are highly unlikely to have encountered
this position before in their entire chess careers, whereas we will be well
prepared as Black to handle the resulting play. Personally, my record of one
win and one draw (in which I missed several wins!) has given me the confidence
to back up the analysis that follows, and I hope you will soon share this view.

only one set of minor pieces exchanged, there remains plenty of play left in
the game. --- This position has only been reached once before (see the game,

may seem passive, but it is critical to understand that White cannot achieve
anything without eventually playing Ne5. Therefore, the queen would be
vulnerable on d7, while other squares are clearly inferior. Furthermore, Black
will now be able to challenge a white knight on e5 with a subsequent ...Nd7.
White's best chances then lie in recapturing on e5 with the d-pawn and
immediately applying pressure on the open d-file. With some careful
manoeuvring on her own first rank, Black can neutralize White's slight
initiative and force major exchanges on the file, after which equality is
inevitable. White can instead try to keep things more closed, but then Black
can finish her development in peace. Common plans often involve playing ...Nd7
anyway, followed by ideas such as ...Bf6, ...Rfd8, and ...Qe7. Alternatively,
she can set up with ...c7-c6, ...Qc7 and ...Rfd8. Usually the king's rook
should go to the d-file. Black can delay the development of the other one, as
the queen's rook is often useful for supporting the a-pawn. In fact, Black
should always be on the lookout for ways to challenge White's queenside
structure via ...a6-a5, with ideas of ...a5-a4 or to control the b4-square and
threaten ...Bb4. Black can often shake up the queenside via ...b7-b5 as well.
--- This all sounds a bit vague at the moment, so let's look at some sample
lines. I should again stress that this position has seen virtually no
practical tests, so you may wish to play over Game 22 (Adair-Smerdon) again if
you still feel uncomfortable with this structure. Furthermore, I have included
the scores of several deep computer-simulated matches between strong engines
that I have run from this position. Going over these games will provide
additional understanding and confidence for the handling of Black's position.
However, you do not have to memorize the lines that follow. I have included
this analysis more for completeness and to supplement your understanding; the
actual positions are certainly not as theoretically critical as in other
variations. --- We will divide up the material in terms of White's choice of
how to develop her queen's bishop:} 13. -- (13. Bb2 {(see variation C21)}) (13.

call 'textbook', and we have seen that Black's chances should not be
underestimated. Charlie's choice is a more sophisticated recipe and,
admittedly, if White really knows her stuff, she can suck some of the spice
out of our attacking chances. Nevertheless, theoretically and objectively,
Black has excellent chances to hold the balance. --- This section is full of

this bishop for her knight in a couple of moves, when her own light-squared
bishop can turn into a monster. After the standard undermining procedure of ...
a7-a6 and ...b7-b5, Black's bishop can find excellent work from either b7 or
a6, while White will often be saddled with one or two isolated d-pawns. Black
can also opt to break down the pawn centre with ...c7-c6 or ...e7-e6 as the
situation dictates; in every scenario, the bishop pair and superior structure
guarantee Black excellent compensation, and often much more than that. --- As
you can see, I have great faith in Black's chances after 3...Nbd7, which is

reaches Portuguese-style positions after the historically most frequent reply,
4 Bc4. However, in modern times White often prefers the calm retreat 4 Be2,
aiming to reach a structure similar to a regular 2...Nf6, 3...Nxd5
Scandinavian, with Black's bishop somewhat awkwardly placed on f5. These
positions are certainly playable for Black, and have been the choice of
experts such as Sergei Krivoshey. Nonetheless, personally I have preferred to
avoid this line, as playing a slightly passive, slightly inferior position out
of the opening doesn't appeal to me. Hence, we will mainly focus on a new idea:
the extremely rare gambit 4 Be2 c6!?.} 4. -- (4. Bc4 {(see variation A1)}) (4.

generally dissuaded me from playing 3...Bd7 in the past. After 4...Bf5 5 d4,
Black will soon be forced back after recapturing on d5, leading to a solid but
slightly inferior position in which White has scored well in practice. To
quote the great Aussie band Powderfinger, that's not my kinda scene.
Fortunately, there is another option:} c6 $5 {The text move of course makes
regular appearances throughout our repertoire, and always seems to deliver a
deceptively rich amount of compensation, even when White hasn't weakened her
structure. In this case, Black's idea revolves around a quick ...e7-e5 before
White has had time to finish her kingside development. From a practical
perspective, Black also immediately puts the pressure back on White, whose
conservative opening play suggests she was hoping for quieter, gambit-free
waters. --- Don't be fooled by Black's abysmal record from this position; the
games in your database have largely featured weaker players on the black side
who quickly failed to make the most of Black's dynamic potential. Rest assured;
Black's compensation contains its measure of venom. Ultimately this sacrifice
is not completely correct, which is another reason why I personally prefer 3...
Nbd7 as my first choice. With very careful, accurate play, White seems to be
able to reach a slightly preferable ending. However, there are plenty of traps

her queen's bishop again anyway, either to f5 or (after Nf3) to g4, but after

about launching a minority attack on the queenside.}) 5... Nxc6 6. d4 {

White will be able to secure an extra pawn for the long term by capturing on
a6, but the resulting structure is positionally favourable to Black. An
excellent outpost on d5 in front of White's isolated pawn, two semi-open files
on the queenside, and a dangerously open long diagonal for her queen's bishop
all amount to very promising, active compensation. Even if White holds out to
an endgame, converting the extra material is extremely difficult with such a
pawn structure, but even more importantly, surviving to an endgame is no easy
feat! --- A key theme to remember in these positions is the move ...N7b6,
which Black will almost certainly play next, threatening to swap off White's
light-squared bishop. If this is achieved, Black's own light-squared bishop
will become a monster, shooting lasers towards the kingside. On the other hand,
if White retreats the bishop from a4, Black can recapture on b5 and continue
to build pressure on all sides of the board. --- Transpositions are rife here,
so it is more important to try to understand Black's thematic ideas than to

Black's typical activity until White is safely developed and castled. For that
reason alone, this move deserves to be more popular. Bizarrely, the game will

White's bishop still on f1. As this bishop will soon retreat anyway, either
voluntarily or after ...c7-c6, we will likely reach an exact transposition.
From a practical perspective, Black has managed to avoid several of White's
more critical alternatives from an Alekhine's move-order; in particular, 6
Nxf7! is considered by current theory (in correspondence chess) to refute
Black's specific sequence. All the same, White's position must still be
considered slightly more pleasant. Play becomes more positional in nature,

king's bishop, should she prefer. However, my preference is to immediately
kick the bishop with 5...c6.} c6 {If Black fianchettoes with 5...g6, White

Black has a pleasant choice. To my mind, blocking with 3...Nbd7 has always
made a lot of sense; in the resulting structures, Black's possession of the
bishop pair should not be underestimated once the position begins to open up.
I have always enjoyed playing this variation. As we have seen, Black's game is
simple, easy to understand and full of explosive potential. --- Although the
more popular 3...Bd7 has never really appealed to me, I must confess that the
brazen gambit 4 Be2 c6!? holds a certain fascination. From a theoretical
perspective there is probably no need for Black to venture down this path in
the search for a full share of the chances, but the positions are relatively
unexplored and certainly look like a lot of fun. --- In short, Black seems to
be holding up very well against the early check.}) *

shock, fear or just sheer spite, will refuse to engage in the tactical anarchy
that comprises the previous four sections. In the final part of the book, we
will briefly consider White's lesser alternatives that, nonetheless, rear
their ugly heads on occasion. --- In short, while nothing in this chapter is
theoretically scary, it is worth spending the time to learn the appropriate
remedies to these lesser alternatives. Doing so will help you transform your
opening positions from easy equality into targeted advantages, and help you
turn those half points into full ones.} 2. -- ({Despite being completely
harmless,} 2. exd5 Nf6 3. Nc3 {appears quite often in practice. In fact, it
has historically been played more frequently than 3 Nf3, which, as we saw, is
a serious attempt at an advantage. The same cannot be said for the queen's
knight's move, but because you will almost certainly face this variation with
some regularity, I have covered it in far more detail than typically accorded
by previous authors of the Scandinavian. Spend the time to understand this
system; it is definitely a worthy investment.}) ({The other variations covered
in this section are far less common.} 2. Nc3 {is simply a bad move in my
opinion, although it is hard to believe that White can actually be worse.
Black should take the chance to grab space and the initiative with} d4 {after
which she has excellent chances to claim an advantage.}) (2. d4 $6 {initiates
the Blackmar-Diemer Gambit, which retains a small but devoted following at
club levels. In a sense, countering Black's sacrifice with a gambit of her own
is an interesting psychological ploy by White. And in fact, you can easily get
in trouble as Black with natural moves if you don't know what you're doing.
You may only face this variation roughly one time in a hundred, but your
opponent likely plays it exclusively and will thus be much better versed in
its subtleties. For this reason, I have again chosen to devote more space to
the BDG than has commonly been considered by other authors. However, there's
no reason to fear. The gambit really is unsound, and with just a little bit of
memorization you can guarantee yourself a hefty opening advantage whenever you
find yourself facing the BDG.}) ({We'll finish things off with a short look at

improved version of a French or Caro-Kann, should you wish it. However, once
again I am going to recommend playing for the maximum. With just a couple of
accurate moves, Black can emerge from the opening with at least a slight
advantage.}) *

1. e4 d5 2. exd5 Nf6 3. Nc3 {White decides to steer the game clear of the wild
tactics that characterize our repertoire. Apart from that, the text is not at
all threatening, leading to a harmless variation of Alekhine's Defence. Having
already equalized, Black can claim to have successfully won the opening battle.
Still, you will face 3 Nc3 roughly one time in ten after 2...Nf6, so it is
definitely worth spending the time to understand the positions that follow.}
Nxd5 {Black regains her pawn and occupies the centre, where the knight will
remain unless it is captured or asked to move. In general, ...Nxc3 is
ill-advised in this variation; Black usually meets Bc4 with ...Nb6, and
otherwise is happy to wait until White breaks the tension with Nxd5. If Black
recaptures on d5 with the queen, one important difference to note between this
and other variations with ...Qxd5 is that Black rarely goes for a kingside
attack. The reason is that the exchange of knights significantly reduces
Black's offensive artillery. On the other hand, one fewer set of minor pieces
eases the cramps in her position, so she can normally achieve easy equality by
castling kingside, completing her development and playing in the centre.} 4. --
{From the diagram, White can lead the play in three directions:} (4. Nf3 {(see
variation A)}) (4. Nxd5 {(see variation B)}) (4. Bc4 {the best and most popular
move (see variation C)}) *

lack of confidence, and this conservatism in the opening usually flows through
to all stages of the game. With deliberate, sensible play, Black can quickly

9. -- {We have reached the key tabiya for 3 Nc3, and you will certainly see
this position many times in your Scandinavian career, so let's take stock. The
position is objectively level but with plenty of play for both sides, so
overall Black should be very happy with the result of the opening. As opposed
to the pawn on e6, White's central pawn on d4 gives her a little more space
but is also a target for the black pieces. Black can increase the pressure
with ...Bg4 and putting a rook on the d-file, though she should be careful of
playing ...Bd6 if White can respond with Ne4. -- From White's perspective, she
would like to throw in a prophylactic h2-h3 to stop the pin on the Nf3.
However, it is a little time-consuming and Black can usually respond with a
quick ...Bf6 and put pressure on the centre. White's mercurial bishop on b3
can prove to be the hero or the villain, depending on whether or not it can
eventually see open space on the a2-g8 diagonal. Black should keep an eye out
for a d4-d5 push, usually by playing either ...Nc6-a5xb3, or by flicking in ...
a7-a5 and, after White's a2-a4, plonking a knight on b4 to control d5.
Occasionally Black decides simply to occupy the square with the other knight
via ...Nb6-d5, though this manoeuvre is sometimes susceptible to getting hit
with a potential c2-c4. --- That is a lot to take in on one go, but note that
memorizing lines from this point is not important. It is far more useful to
get a feel for the ideas and themes in the position, and the best way to do
that is to see how strong players on the black side have handled things. Let's

1. e4 d5 2. Nc3 {is yet another harmless sideline, but it is also the most
popular of White's alternatives to 2 exd5. Consequently, it is worth paying
some attention to my suggestions below, because you are likely to face this
variation more often than you might expect, and a bit of effort can leave you
well placed to push for an opening advantage. By the way, the diagram is often
reached via Van Geet's opening: 1 Nc3 d5 2 e4.} d4 $1 {Transpositional
possibilities abound: 2...e6 leads to the French Defence, 2...c6 to the
Caro-Kann, and 2...Nf6 to the Alekhine's Defence. Alternatively, Black has a
choice between gaining space through the text move, and the more open 2...dxe4.
The capture is more popular and usually leads to positions closely resembling
the Caro-Kann where Black has saved a move by omitting ...c7-c6. This has
often been suggested by authors in the past as an easy way to equalize - which
is true, and may be more to your taste - but I prefer to pronounce loftier
ambitions and immediately claim the centre. After the text, which I consider
the strongest move, White will have a hard fight to reach equality.} 3. Nce2 e5
{A critical juncture for this variation. White is striving to reach some sort
of reversed defence - such as the King's Indian, Old Indian, or Nimzowitsch (1
e4 Nc6) - with an extra tempo. In an ideal world, she manages Ng3, Nf3, Bc4,
d2-d3 and 0-0 with active play. Black, on the other hand, has ambitiously
grabbed the extra space on offer and will enjoy a positional advantage if she
can prevent White's plan. In most of the lines I am recommending, two key
themes emerge. Firstly, Black shouldn't allow White's light-squared bishop to
enjoy too much freedom, instead aiming to restrict this piece as much as
possible; ...Be6 is a typical move in this respect. Secondly, Black can often
view the white knights on g3 and f3 as targets rather than threats, preferring
to castle long and launch a pawn storm on the kingside. With accurate play, it
is my belief that Black should enjoy the better chances. --- From the diagram,
White has explored three main options. In decreasing order of popularity, they
are:} 4. -- (4. Ng3 {(see variation A)}) (4. Nf3 {(see variation B)}) (4. d3 {
(see variation C)}) ({The immediate} 4. f4 $6 {is inaccurate, as White is
underprepared for this early thrust:} exf4 5. Nxf4 Bd6 6. d3 Nf6 7. Nf3 O-O 8.
Be2 Re8 9. O-O c5 $1 {gives Black a healthy advantage after very natural moves.

, and now the toothless continuation} 5. fxe5 ({in this line} 5. Nf3 {is much

counter-sacrifice! This sideline is only encountered roughly one game in every
hundred that starts with 1 e4 d5, but note that it can also arise via the more
common move-order 1 d4 d5 2 e4?!.} dxe4 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. f3 {The Blackmar-Diemer
Gambit, or 'BDG' as it is more commonly known to its (often fanatic) exponents.
Devotees of this gambit are often zealous to the extent that nothing can
persuade them of its unsoundness, and who are we to judge such dogmatism about
a dubious defence? In fact, despite most opening texts dismissing 2 d4 with
barely a mention, the gambit can be tricky to face over the board,
particularly against a bloodthirsty opponent who knows the theory back to
front. What's more, it occurs in club chess, and especially blitz, far more
often than you might expect. Consequently, I have decided to spend a bit of
time shoring up Black's repertoire, and I recommend you do the same. But make
no mistake: this gambit is completely unsound, and with good preparation Black
can be hopeful of coming out of the opening with at least a slight advantage
and likely much more than that.} Bf5 {There are several ways of playing
against the BDG that are more than satisfactory for Black, but in my opinion
the so-called 'Vienna' variation, which begins from the diagram, is the most
dynamic counter-punch. Instead of cashing in on the extra pawn with 4...exf3
and then going into staunch defensive mode, Black continues to prioritize
development. Indeed, in many of the variations that follow, Black often
prefers to give back the pawn in exchange for rapid development and piece
activity. A common theme is the long-term instability of White's king, who
often fails to find a safe haven on either side of the board. Furthermore,
Black may well play ...e4xf3 at a more promising moment if White ignores the
tension in the centre. Having said all that, Black needs to remain careful in
order to ensure that White doesn't whip up the sort of coffeehouse attack that
features so often in BDG miniatures.} ({The recommended response for White in
most BDG texts is to capture on e4, which is also the most common reply.
However, I believe Black should be very happy to see this on the board as,
with a well-timed return of the material, she can quickly get a promising
position. More testing is 5 g4!?, which leads to unusual and complex
variations that should perfectly suit most readers - particularly because
Black comes out on top even against White's best play. Finally, White has a
couple of less common bishop moves that shouldn't pose too many problems. ---
Although Black can be guaranteed of an opening advantage after the text, I
perfectly understand that some readers would prefer not to have to learn a
reasonable body of theory just to refute an opening that occurs so seldom. For
the lazy among us, then, an easy shortcut to equality that you can learn in
less than ten minutes is} 4... Nbd7 $5 {If you're not in the mood to face a
gambit, like playing endings, or just want to unsettle your BDG foe, 4...
Nbd7!? is a very interesting, but rarely played, sideline that will almost
certainly take your opponent by surprise. Against a bloodthirsty gambiteer, it
can be a very powerful and annoying retort, as White is virtually forced to
enter a level endgame:} 5. fxe4 (5. Bc4 e5 $1) 5... e5 $1 {clearly the point

long-term positional compensation. --- There is only one line that Black needs

Unfortunately, after} 10. Ng5 $5 {, Black took the bait and fell for} Be7 ({
instead,} 10... Qc7 {would have left Black with a clear advantage}) 11. Nxf7
Kxf7 12. Qf3+ {and White won a pawn}) 3. c3 (3. f4 Nc6 4. Nf3 Bg4 $1 {
demonstrates the key advantage of having a French-like structure with the
e-pawn back home. Then} 5. c3 ({after} 5. Bb5 e6 6. O-O Nge7 7. h3 Bxf3 8. Qxf3
Nf5 {, Black has a dream French Defence}) 5... e6 6. Bb5 Nge7 7. O-O a6 8. Ba4
{was already good for Black in Pa.Dimitrov-G.A.Szabo, Sunny Beach 2009, and
here} b5 9. Bc2 d4 $1 {was the most accurate way to press home the advantage.})
3... Nc6 (3... c4 $5 {is a more unusual approach. After} 4. d4 cxd3 5. Bxd3 Nc6

score to a comfortable victory in A.Shirshova-E.Alekseev, Uljanovsk 2009
(that's not GM Alekseev, by the way).}) 4. d4 {Again inviting a transposition
to a French should Black continue 4...e6. It's perhaps worth noting that the
Advance French is considered perfectly acceptable for Black from a theoretical
perspective, but she should certainly prefer taking advantage of our
Scandinavian move-order.} ({Instead,} 4. f4 d4 {gives Black a structural
advantage not dissimilar to the lines analysed after 2...d4, and} 5. d3 f6 6.

upsss (2000)-D.Smerdon, Internet 2013.}) 4... Bf5 $1 5. Nf3 e6 {After teasing
each other with transpositional dance moves, the waltz has led us again to a
nice French, or a souped-up Caro-Kann, depending on your imagination. One
thing is clear: Black is doing very well.} ({For example,} 5... e6 6. Bb5 Qb6
7. Bxc6+ bxc6 {was already a bit better for Black in M.Vandervorst-Vl.Georgiev,
La Fere 2012 (in which this position arose via a c2-c3 Sicilian).}) (5... -- {
Section Five - Conclusion: White should be wary of trying to dodge a
theoretical debate with these sidelines. Black's first move, 1...d5, is in a
sense her most ambitious answer to 1...e4, as it immediately seeks to gain
superiority in space and in the centre. Should White not take up the challenge
with one of the replies from the previous sections, then Black's ambition is
rewarded with at least equality from the opening, and in many cases a rapid
advantage. --- Of White's options in this section, only 2 exd5 Nf6 3 Nc3 can
be considered fully sound. You will face this reasonably often in practice,
though White can lay no claim to an advantage - the resulting positions are
equal, while retaining sufficient imbalance that all results are possible.
Against White's other choices at move two, the news is even better: you should
now feel confident to press for the full point straight from the word go!}) *

{Wow, that was a long book. And you made it all the way to the end - well
done! It has been a joy to write, but it turned out to be a much bigger book
than I expected. There are three reasons for this.} 1. -- (1. -- {Firstly, as
I wrote each chapter, I discovered many new ideas, for both sides, that have
never before been played or published. This is evident from the high number of
novelties scattered throughout the chapters, and which any reader of a new
opening book should be happy to see. I wish you many quick and effortless
points on account of these discoveries!}) (1. -- {Secondly, I wanted to make
sure that all lines were covered, even those that I don't personally believe
are very important. This meant going deep into branches that objectively
aren't threatening, but may well crop up more often than they ought to in
practice. In particular, I have placed extra focus on variations that occur
with high frequency, such as the Wuss and the surprisingly common 3 Nc3 in
Section Five.}) (1. -- {And finally, seeing as this is the first comprehensive
repertoire project to focus on 3...Bg4, I wanted the book to stand the test of
time. There will undoubtedly be corrections and improvements on this work in
the future as chess computers grow stronger, and so I have been as thorough as
I possibly can, double- and triple-checking the analysis with multiple engines.
Despite my best efforts, some lines in this book will inevitably be cast as
dubious by authors and theoreticians at some point or another, which is why I
have offered alternative lines for Black in most chapters. --- It may yet come
to pass that our favourite weapon is eventually banished to the backwaters of
refuted openings; but even if such a tragedy does occur, I sincerely hope that
this book provides you with a hefty double-dose of pleasurable reading and
sparkling victories for many years to come.}) *
