{In this book, Williams examines the Classical Dutch in great depth. He also
presents a complete repertoire for Black with the Dutch Defence, which is
based on his own repertoire he has used successfully at grandmaster level for
many years. As well as presenting the latest theory and revealing his new
ideas in the key lines, Williams highlights the main tactical and strategic
ideas for both sides and covers important issues such as move orders.} 1. -- {
Each chapter includes a series of tests at the end, so that readers are able
to assess how well they have understood the main concepts. This books tells
you everything you need to know about successfully playing the Classical Dutch.

whose previous books have received great praise. He is much admired for his
dynamic and spontaneous attacking style.}) *

{"Do not go where the path may lead, go instead where there is no path and
leave a trail." - Ralph Waldo Emerson. --- Throughout this book, I have
'borrowed' quotes from people greater than myself. This is because I have
neither the literary skill nor ability to come up with such great sayings. In
this day and age of Google, such prized quotes are readily accessible. I have,
therefore, concentrated my time and effort on the chess material shown in this
book.} 1. d4 f5 {. Introductory Words: The Classical Dutch has possessed my
chess soul for over twenty years now. Throughout this period of my life, and
despite all the ups and downs, it is still my best chess friend. Indeed, I
have had some of my greatest results playing the Classical Dutch. --- At the
tender age of nine, I was introduced to the opening by my dad, so you can
blame him for everything that follows! Since then, it has become my routine
answer to 1 d4, 1 c4 and 1 Nf3. --- The Classical Dutch is an opening that
will favour the brave, i.e. players who want an interesting fight from the
start of the game. It is an original opening that offers many exciting options.
Just in the making of this book, I have come across new ideas that have never
been played before. --- I would describe the Classical Dutch as an aggressive
and tactical opening, but it also has some complex positional aspects. The
middlegame often involves a tactical battle but just as often, players who
enter these types of positions can also find themselves "grinding away" with
their positional advantage. --- It is true that the general reputation of the
Dutch Defence is quite poor. Top players tend to refer to the opening as one
might to a dangerous-looking biker, one that you might encounter in a late
night bar: wary, slightly scared, but also with a hidden sense of fascination
and respect. --- One of my favourite quotes on the Dutch was made by top
Grandmaster Artur Yusupov. "The problem with the Dutch is that Black very
often in the middlegame finds that his best available move is f5-f7." That
quote may well be true in some cases, but 'Freddy the f-pawn' can also be a
very dangerous attacking unit! --- The Classical Dutch is an opening that
suits me perfectly. One of the advantages I have over my opponents is that I
have a very good understanding of what both sides should be doing, thanks to
my vast experience in this opening. In fact, when I play some of the world's
best players, my understanding of the opening is sometimes greater even than
theirs. This is due to the fact that the Classical Dutch is a rather rare
opening and many players will not know how to respond to it. For example, take
a look at my games against Sokolov, Gelfand and Shirov. In all cases, I
obtained a good position from the opening. With this in mind, I believe that
the Classical Dutch is a reputable opening which can be successfully used
against the best of players. --- During my chess adventures, I have dabbled
with the Kings Indian Defence, English Defence, Black Knights' Tango, the Slav
and even 1...Nc6, but none of these openings has ever appealed to me, or
scored as well for me, as the Classical Dutch. --- Indeed, some people have
even had the cheek to ask me, "Simon, I bought your 2002 book on the Dutch 
(Play the Classical Dutch) and now you have given up playing it. Why? What is
wrong with the opening?"} (1... -- {With regard to the above, my thoughts are
better explained by the fantasy author Terry Pratchett: "Why do you go away?
So that you can come back. So that you can see the place you came from with
new eyes and extra colours. And the people there see you differently, too.
Coming back to where you started is not the same as never leaving." --- (Terry
Pratchett: A Hat Full of Sky)}) (1... -- {This book is aimed at players of all
strengths and its real purpose is to arm those players with a dangerous weapon
that can be used against either 1 d4, 1 c4 or 1 Nf3. I also hope that this
book will be of use to players who play 1 d4 as well. Even if they don't enter
into a Classical Dutch, they will inevitably improve by getting to grips with
the types of positions featured in this book. --- Each chapter of the book
starts with some important games that demonstrate the main themes and ideas of
the chapter. Afterwards, the theory is introduced and analysed in great detail,
with all relevant variations discussed. At the end of some of the main
chapters, typical middlegame and endgame positions are shown and an
explanation as to the plans of each player is also given, so that the player
is fully prepared. --- I would recommend that you first read the book from
start to finish and then you are free to concentrate on any particular chapter
after that. --- To start with, let us take a look at how I used the Classical
Dutch to destroy a top Grandmaster in twenty moves (see the following game).})

{This game was played in the first round of the 2011 French Team Championships.
I was rather angry before the start of the game and to be honest, the result
of the match was pretty irrelevant to me. I expect, for that reason, I was
able to play in the way that I did, i.e. with reckless abandon! --- My
opponent was rated 2721 at the time and the second of the World Champion,
Vishy Anand. Obviously they had not studied the Classical Dutch together...} 1.

the ...e5 break, he should generally be feeling confident.} 9. b3 e5 10. dxe5

annoying move to deal with. The knight reaches a dangerous outpost on b5
pressurising Black's queenside, but why care about the queenside when
checkmate is the end of the game!} Qh5 $5 {An outrageous move! The safe option
would have been ...Bd8 with a perfectly fine position, but why be safe when
you can live a little...} 13. Nxc7 f4 {After this game, a well-known GM came
up to me and his comment went something along the lines of, "Simon, how can
you show such a complete disregard for classical chess principles and go on to
beat such a strong player?" To which I responded, "Surely, the main principle
of chess is checkmate?" --- The plan is clear: I simply want to put all my
pieces onto the most aggressive squares possible, namely those that all point
towards White's king, then the rest should play itself! --- If I lose, life
goes on, but at least I have had some entertainment along the way!} 14. Nxa8

am only a rook and one pawn down which is nothing really. Morphy used to give
those types of odds all the time!} 15. Rd5 $2 {My opponent cracks immediately
but facing such an attack from such an unpredictable player must have been
quite disconcerting.} (15. gxf4 {was later found to be a better move, but it

not so for my opponent, who appeared to be left reeling in a state of shock. I
noticed that Wojtaszek's Elo rating has taken a bit of plunge since this game.
I guess that is the effect that the Dutch and I have on people... --- A lot of
comments were made about this game and my "crazy" idea of simply sacrificing
the queenside pieces in order to enhance my attack on the kingside.
Furthermore, a number of people have stated that 12...Qh5 was a great novelty,
but the truth of the matter is that I had already used this idea a number of
years ago. It was first played in the world under-20 championships in Yerevan
after, dare I say, a rather late night with my friend Torbjorn Hansen. I doubt
that I would have ever considered this concept if I had had a clear head at
the time. Let us take a quick look at the game in question.}) 0-1

treat and this time, I know that my opponent had prepared. --- The following
game must rate as one of my best-ever victories, but to be honest it was a
very scrappy game, with some rather poor play from both sides at certain
points. The game became very messy and somehow, I managed to find my way
through the murkiness. In general, I enjoy playing games that have entered
'the chaos zone', as trench fighting is one of my strong points. --- The

{The following game is a great advertisement for the Classical Dutch. Richard
Pert, a good friend of mine, played this game fantastically, as he
demonstrated just how dangerous the attack can become. The game also shows
some important points that are worth bearing in mind. Let's take a look.} 1.
Nf3 f5 {From the start, Black takes control of the central e4-square.} 2. g3 (
2. d3 {is quite an annoying response to 1...f5, as now an early e4 can open up
Black's position. We will examine this response in detail in Section 7.}) 2...
Nf6 3. Bg2 d6 ({This aims to save a tempo i.e.} 3... e6 4. O-O Be7 5. d3 d6 6.
c4 e5 {and Black has moved his e-pawn twice.}) 4. O-O ({White can also play} 4.
d4 {which stops ...e5. Black then has the option of staying with the Classical
Dutch with ...e6 or switching to a Leningrad with ...g6.}) 4... e5 {The goal
of any Classical Dutch player is to achieve this push. Once Black has played ..
.e5 it gives him a strong centre and a chance to attack on the kingside.} 5. d3
$6 {I already think that this move is a slight mistake. White is playing the
opening without too much thought. After this move, Black's plan of action
pretty much plays itself. --- This just goes to show that some players
automatically play their opening moves against any set-up. Chess is a
complicated game and you need to think from an early stage. This is especially
true if your opponent plays something unexpected in the opening!} (5. d4 {is a
better move, as at least this disrupts Black's set-up.}) 5... Be7 6. c4 O-O 7.
Nc3 a5 {Black can also play without this move, as I sometimes feel that the
exchange of a-pawns can actually help White. This is due to the fact that
White will generally be attacking on the queenside whilst Black will be
attacking on the kingside, and after a3-b4 and the exchange ...axb4 axb4,
White has the open a-file to play down.} 8. Rb1 {Preparing to launch with a3
and b4.} (8. a3 Kh8 9. Rb1 Qe8 10. b4 axb4 11. axb4 {transposes.}) 8... Kh8 {
Black does not need to play this move straightaway but it is useful to move
the king away from the a2-g8 diagonal. At some point in the future, White will
often move his queen to b3 and at least Black can now avoid any nasty checks.}
9. a3 {Let's take a time-out. --- I was watching this game and had noticed
that both sides had reached this position using hardly any time on their
clocks. It was only around now that they started to knuckle down. White is
planning b4, b5/c5 and then hopefully, he will be able to create a weakness on
the queenside. Black, on the other hand, is not going to mess about. He is not
interested in creating a weakness. Black just wants to checkmate White's king!
--- To do this, Black will need to play: ...Qe8, Qh5, f4, Bh3, Ng4, fxg3, Bxg2,
Rxf3, and Qxh2#! --- You will be amazed at how many times this plan is
successful. Anyway, to sum up the position, I would always say that it is more
fun to attack your opponent's king than anything else. White may win a pawn on
the queenside if his attack is successful. On the other hand, if Black's
attack successful, he will checkmate White!} Qe8 $1 {BRAINSTORMING POINT! ---
This is Step 1 of Black's plan... --- If you are going to reach the 'Jedi
Knight level' then you must become familiar with this plan! --- ...Qe8 and ...Qh5 is an important idea. The queen is often well placed on h5. --- ...Qh5
won't checkmate White on its own but when combined with ...e5 ...f4 ...Bh3 and
...Ng4, Black's attack can be very dangerous. --- Just look at what happens in
this game...} 10. b4 Qh5 {BRAINSTORMING POINT! --- Step 2...The queen finds
its ideal square --- The main piece that is defending White's kingside is his
light-squared bishop. --- If Black can swap off White's light-squared bishop
then the light squares around White's king will become especially weak. ---
For that reason, Black plans on playing ...Bh3 at some point.} 11. Qb3 $2 {
White is playing without a care in the world. This move does not do anything;
it may actually make White's position worse. Having the queen on d1 gives
White more chances to defend.} ({White should have played} 11. e3 $1 {. At
least this attempts to stop ...f4. White would also love to swap the queens
and now this may be possible if he can move the knight on f3.}) 11... f4 {
Simple.} 12. Nd5 {White hopes that the exchange of knights will ease his
defence, but Black has another knight!} Nxd5 13. cxd5 {The open c-file is not
a major concern for Black as he can always defend c7 with the move Bd8. The
main factor is White's king!} axb4 14. axb4 {What would you play here? ---
Black has a promising position but what piece is not taking part in the game?}
Nd7 $1 {Correct! This knight has a good future and Black will eventually
manoeuvre it to f6 and then to g4 where it can participate in the attack.} 15.
Bd2 Nf6 $1 {Black is sending all of his pieces the right way.} 16. Ra1 {
White's counterplay on the queenside is far too slow.} Rb8 17. Rfc1 Bh3 $5 {
This is slightly risky as it does sacrifice a pawn, but if White captures on
c7 then Black will be able to activate his dark-squared bishop - the only
minor piece that is currently not doing a lot.} (17... Bd8 {is a perfectly
safe option.}) 18. Be1 {This is rather passive.} ({White should probably have
tried} 18. Rxc7 {. White is defending desperately anyway, so it may have been
best to capture this pawn. At least this way, White has a material advantage.
If Black does not checkmate White then this could count in the long run. ---
Play could continue} Bd8 19. Rcc1 Bb6 {, which still looks very good for Black.
I would be surprised if the white king can last for another ten moves.}) 18...

should have tried} 19. Rxc7 Bd8 20. Rc4 {with some defensive chances:} Bb6 21.
Ra2 {.}) 19... fxg3 {Opening up the f-file. At the moment, White's knight

DVD for GingerGM Publishing, on the Grand Prix opening, and in this type of
position he summed up Black's plan in two stages: 1) Keep pressure on the
c-pawns. Black does this by playing moves such as ...Na5 ...Rb8 ...b6, ...Ba6.
This positional approach also stops White from gaining any attacking chances
along the half open b-file. --- 2) Aim for a speedy kingside attack in

kingside attack.} 10. Qb3 $2 {Another mistake, as the queen is badly placed on
the queenside and this move allows Black the option of playing ...b6. From my
experience, I have always found it toughest for Black to attack when White
leaves his queen on d1 and then tries to open the d1-h5 diagonal with e3 and
Nd2. Playing in this manner, White can offer a queen exchange when Black's
queen has reached h5. White would love to exchange queens, as then his king
becomes a lot less likely to be checkmated!} ({Other options include:} 10. e3

1. -- (1. d4 f5 {The Classical Dutch has had an exciting history. It has been
used as a weapon of choice by many well-known players who are famous for their
aggressive and creative styles. --- Indeed, a number of world champions and
challengers have used the opening, such as Morphy, Alekhine, Capablanca,
Botvinnik, Bronstein, Spassky, Korchnoi and Tal - an impressive list! --- The
Dutch Defence was discovered by the Dutchman Stein, hence the name of the
opening. Elias Stein was born in Holland in 1748, and he pointed out the
similarities between the Dutch Defence and the Sicilian Defence. If you look
at the first move, you can see that the two openings are similar, due to the
fact that the initial pawn structures of both openings are actually mirror
images of one another.}) (1. e4 c5 {Given the popularity of the Sicilian
Defence, I do find it surprising that the Dutch is not as well-liked.
Hopefully, over the course of this book, I can change any negative
pre-conceptions that you may have of this opening! --- The Dutch has had a
turbulent life, with grandmasters and even world champions differing in their
personal opinion of the opening. For example, Wilhelm Steinitz condemned the
opening after he defeated Zukertort, who used it in a match against him. On
the other hand the great Alexander Alekhine used the Dutch on a regular basis,
and had some great victories with the opening. --- It is fair to say that
nowadays the Classical Dutch has a dubious reputation, but who knows what the
world will think of the opening in 20 years from now!?}) *

11. fxe4 Rxf1+ 12. Kxf1 $5 {. As strange as this move looks, it is the
computer's top pick. We will look at this position in some detail later in
this book. --- Personally I have been struggling against an early Nh3 plan.
One of the first times this was introduced into top level chess was in the
encounter Karpov-Short, a game which we look at later on. My score over the
last three years against this idea has been awful. That is why I look at that
variation in some depth in this book. --- I must confess that my bad score
against this plan can be put down more to laziness than the actual strength of
White's idea. After some careful work, it seems that Black has little to fear
if he simple sticks to a plan based on ...c6, ...Qc7 and, ...e5, but again we
will look at this in much more detail later in this book.}) ({Another trend
that I have noticed recently is} 1. Nf3 f5 2. d3 $5 {. A young Magnus Carlsen
once used this move and since that moment it has blossomed in popularity. The
simple idea behind 2 d3 is for White to continue with 3 e4, creating a
dangerous initiative in the centre of the board. --- Currently it looks like
the most active and best response to 2 d3!? is the counter attacking idea} Nc6
$5 {. This move was mentioned by Moskalenko in his book 'The Diamond Dutch'
and was also mentioned in my first book 'The Classical Dutch'. --- Jump to the

the Classical Dutch is alive and kicking!}) *

1. d4 f5 {. I will quickly talk about the structure of this book and some
important things to bear in mind when working your way through it. --- In the
past, when I have been learning a new opening, I have always found that the
best way to do this is to understand the reasoning behind the moves played and
not the actual moves themselves. It is much more important to understand the
concept behind an idea rather than to memorise a series of moves without any
real understanding as to why those moves should be played. --- To enforce this
point, I have used a number of methods throughout this book which will help
the reader increase their understanding of the Classical Dutch. --- Firstly, I
have used several 'brainstorming points' in order to explain the reasoning
behind the moves played and what each side is trying to achieve in the given
position. --- Furthermore, a lot of the key points are repeated throughout
this book, again with the intention of making the idea more memorable. This
has been done systematically in order to help the reader commit the same ideas
to memory and become 'a Jedi Knight of the Classical Dutch'! --- Finally, at
the end of some of the chapters, I have used a series of tests to assess
whether the main concepts of the chapter have been fully understood. If you
have read the chapter then these tests should not pose too much of a problem
but then again, they are there to reinforce the main ideas behind the
Classical Dutch. --- I can honestly say that there are not too many 'Jedi
Knight' level, Classical Dutch players in existence. Can you obtain that rank?}

more detail about each of these rules above: Concerning Rule One above: when
White plays e4 and Black is forced to capture with ...fxe4, White normally
gains an advantage due to the following reasons:} (1. -- {1) After e4 fxe4,
White has a half open e-file at his disposal. White can place a rook on this
file to place pressure against Black's weak pawn on e6. --- Take a look at the
following typical pawn structure, a pawn structure that occurs after e4 ...fxe4. This will demonstrate my point above in more detail. --- Black's pawn on
e6 is very weak. White can easily attack this pawn by placing a rook on the
e-file. On the other hand White does not have any weaknesses in his position.

structure is often a great base around which to build a kingside attack and it
will also often give Black a nice spatial advantage in the centre of the board.
--- The following diagram shows the typical pawn structure that I am talking
about: Black has managed to gain some space in the centre. This can often lead
to a kingside attack, as we saw in some of the introductory games.}) ({2) It

on c8 can enter into the game. This is even more true after Black has also
played the move} 1... f4 {reaching the following position. --- You may now be
able to imagine Black's light-squared bishop on c8 entering into the game via

dangerous, as we saw in Sowray-Pert. --- Of course there are going to be

{Another bit of advice following on from the theme above is: BRAINSTORMING
POINT! --- Leave that bishop on c8 alone!} 1. d4 f5 {. Rule 2: Do not be in a
rush to develop your light-squared bishop: Lots of players when starting out
with the Classical Dutch are far too eager to develop their light-squared
bishop too quickly. It is often best to leave the bishop on c8 and only move
it into the game when there is a better option. --- The bishop on c8 actually
does a good job of defending the b7 pawn, so the bishop on c8 is often best
left alone. If you have managed to play ...e5 and ...f4 then it may well be
time to move the bishop into the game via the g4-square or the h3-square. ---
Look at the games in the introduction to this book - in all the examples Black
is quite happy not developing this piece, at least not until it really counts.
--- BRAINSTORMING POINT! --- The 'Swinging Queen'. Attack with ...Qe8 and ...Qh5!} (1... -- {"My style is schizophrenic! One minute I'll be wearing bright

a much superior opening compared to the Classical Dutch. I disagree, as the
Leningrad is a different opening altogether. --- Take a look at the following
position, it shows a pawn structure that often occurs in the Leningrad Dutch.

takes at least four moves ...Qe8, ...h6 (the pawn on g6 is in the way!!!), ...g5 and finally ...Qh5! --- Very slow! In the Classical Dutch, the Black queen
can pop out to h5 in super-quick time. --- We saw this happen perfectly in the
introductory games Sowray-Pert and Svidler-Carlsen, to name but two. I have
also managed to make this idea work in countless games (see the following game)

normally fianchettoes his king's bishop against the Classical Dutch, and there
is a good reason for this. The king's fianchetto normally prevents Black from
playing ...b6, which is a move he wants to play. --- If White does not
fianchetto his bishop then it is often a good idea for Black to play ...b6 and
...Bb7.} 1. -- {I used to believe that Black should always play ...b6 and ...Bb7 when given a chance, but over time I have come to believe that this is not
true, and in most cases Black can still play ...d6 and ...e5. Saying that, you

light-squared bishop. --- The following game demonstrates a time when I used

Dutch. --- BRAINSTORMING POINT! --- You should always aim to meet the pawn
push d4-d5 with the counter push ...e5. --- This idea is better explained with

{2. An attack should be based around a good solid position. This will often
mean a position where Black has already played ...e5, managed to develop some
pieces and gained an initiative. In the following game I chose the wrong plan:
I now played:} 17... g5 $6 {My position was already tricky but this advance is
wrong. My pieces are too passive for any kingside pawn storm and I also have
no attack, so this 'aggressive' idea does not deserve to work.} 18. g4 $1 {A
very nice response! White sacrifices a pawn to gain complete control of the
e4-square. If my g-pawn was still back on g6 things would not be as bad,
because I could always meet gxf5 with ...gxf5, but this is not possible here.}
Bg7 19. gxf5 Bxf5 20. Ne4 Qb6+ 21. Kh1 Qg6 22. Qe2 {White is clearly better.
--- 3. A kingside attack will work better when the pawn structure and black
kingside remain "closed". In other words, if White has a chance to open up the
position and start a counterattack, then an 'all in' approach may fail. ---
Remember only attack when there is a good chance of success, if there is not
then build up the position first.} *

{Example 3: ...h5-h4: We see the same plan in action below, albeit it in a
rather strange way. I was playing with the white pieces, and just to make
things even more confusing, I was paired against my namesake S.Williams! --- A
number of strange things have occurred to me and other S.Williams' throughout
my life as a chess professional. Around about ten years previous to this game,
FIDE had used "the other" S.Williams games to rate my performance on the new
FIDE rating list. So there I was, on my way to my first game at the Hastings
international, expecting my rating to be about 2450, when I got a major shock
to see that my rating had dropped to 2250! Thanks FIDE! --- On another
occasion I had done some coaching work for two solid weeks for the English
junior team. My payment cheque for this work got sent out to another S.Williams, who lived about 200 miles from me! Luckily he was very honest and
passed the payment onto me! Thanks English Chess Federation! --- The game
below started off as a Classical Dutch reversed (as in Svidler-Carlsen and
Williams-Zhong Zhao). I will show you the opening moves, just out of interest.
--- It is worth noting that what you can learn in the Classical Dutch can
clearly be transferred to other openings and vice versa. Transferable skills
are always a good thing to have, and we will take a more detailed look at this

{What openings are similar to the Dutch? --- Can you use this to your
advantage? --- The Classical Dutch has a lot of similarities with various
other openings. These similarities might come in the type of pawn structure,
typical middlegame plans and various other forms. You can aim to use to this
to your advantage by keeping things simple and picking openings that follow
the same trends. --- What openings do I consider to be similar to the
Classical Dutch? The list below are openings that keep the same
characteristics:} 1. -- {White perspective:} ({Bird's Opening:} 1. f4 {Plus
Points: This is the Dutch reversed with an extra tempo! We saw me use this
opening in one the introductory games to score a good victory. If you want to
save a lot of time learning how to play with the white pieces, then this could
be an interesting way to play. --- I have used this move from time to time,
and I basically aim to do precisely what I would do in the normal Classical
Dutch, but a tempo up. --- I am normally careful who I play this plan against.
I would normally only play 1 f4 against players who always play 1 e4
themselves. --- Why? --- I want to get people out of what they are used to
playing, and by playing 1 f4 the position will transpose into a 1 d4 opening
reversed, and if my opponent always plays 1 e4 he will be uncomfortable with
the position that he has been forced into. --- All in all, 1 f4 for me is a
great surprise weapon. --- Downside: The only extra thing that you need to
learn here is From's Gambit, which is where Black plays 1...e5! Then you have
the option of capturing the pawn or entering into a Kings Gambit with the move
2 e4!?. --- Nowadays I use 1 f4 as a surprise opening, as it gets a bit boring
playing the Dutch all the time. It is a good idea to try to understand new
positions, as this will increase your overall understanding of our great game.
--- You should also be trying to gain an opening advantage when playing with
the white pieces, and as good as the Classical Dutch is, it does not offer any
advantage to Black (or White in this case!).}) ({The Grand Prix:} 1. e4 c5 2.

then you will know how to attack in the Grand Prix. --- Take a look at the
following game which came from one of my games with the White pieces.}) *

offered Black good chances to play for a win. Indeed, the positions that it
leads to are often complex and exciting. --- 7...a5 is a very useful waiting
move as it takes control of the b4-square. This square can often be used as a
good outpost for Black's knight or even bishop. --- One of the most enjoyable
encounters that I have had in this line was against Joseph Gallagher. I was
due to play Joe at the Isle of Man tournament. Joe was riding high as he had
just won the British Championship, so he was obviously on good form. --- I had
Black against him and I thought that it would be an ideal time to try out my
favourite line i.e. 7...a5, the line we are about to look at. I had only one
concern: I was worried about one move and coincidentally, Joe played that move
immediately!} 8. Re1 {. After this move, I had a long think and came up with a
very good plan. A plan that, until recently, still looked good. --- However,
there does seem to be a major drawback with this whole variation. GM Stephen
Gordon highlighted the problem in his game against a very unsuspecting Marcus
Harvey at the 2012 British Championship. --- The idea was first shown to me by
Stephen over two years ago. I have decided to keep it hidden until now. This
idea does seem to leave the whole 7...a5 variation in doubt... We will take a
look at this idea after the first two introductory games. --- Let's have the
good news before the bad!} *

This used to be the old main line and 8 Re1 was the move I feared! --- Black
certainly needs to know what he is doing against this move. White is planning
to play e4 when he will gain a positional advantage. Black should aim to stop
this at all costs. --- BRAINSTORMING POINT! --- At the start of this book, I
pointed out some basic strategic points that Black needs to know. One of these
springs to mind now. --- If White can achieve the e4 advance without Black
playing ...e5 and Black has to exchange with ...fxe4, White will generally
obtain an advantage. --- Black has to stop White from playing e4 here. There
is only one way of doing this.} Ne4 {This move is pretty much forced. ---
BRAINSTORMING POINT! --- Black must stop White from playing e4!} 9. Qc2 Nxc3 $1
{This is an important improvement on the old main line (see later).} 10. Qxc3 {
This is the natural response to 9...Nxc3! as it keeps White's pawns intact but
I don't believe that it is the best move.} ({We will take a look at} 10. bxc3
$1 {in the Theory section of this book, as this move is a better attempt at
gaining an opening advantage for White.}) 10... Nc6 $1 {I now had a long think
as I had to try and do something about White's plan of playing e4. The real
point of ...Nc6 becomes clear after White's next move.} 11. e4 {BRAINSTORMING
POINT! --- Let's go back to one of the general rules. You should know it by
now: If White can achieve the e4 advance without Black playing ...e5 and Black
has to exchange with ...fxe4, White will generally obtain an advantage.} e5 $1
{Yes, this is the correct response! We can now see why the pawn on a5 is good.
It secures the b4-square for a black piece. This dynamic move holds the
position together. Only the central counter-strike will stop White from
gaining an advantage.} 12. exf5 {We will come back to White's two other
possibilities in the theory section.} Bxf5 13. Be3 $2 {This is too passive.} ({
White should have tried} 13. dxe5 {which is looked at below.}) 13... Be4 {An
exchange of light-squared bishops can only help Black. White will then have
some weakened squares around his kingside (h3, g2, f3) and will have lost his
best minor piece, the light-squared bishop. Furthermore, White's light-squared
bishop often puts pressure on Black's queenside.} 14. Nd2 $6 (14. Bd2 {was
better.}) 14... Bxg2 15. Kxg2 d5 $1 {It is time to pause and reflect on the
position that has arisen from the opening. White's pieces are all looking

at any moment.} 16. a3 Bf6 17. Nf3 exd4 18. Nxd4 Qd7 19. Rad1 Ne5 20. c5 Nf3 $1

{Let's take a look at another game that I have played in this variation. This
time, we will concentrate on 8 b3, which is one of White's most popular moves.
} 1. d4 e6 2. c4 f5 3. g3 Nf6 4. Bg2 Be7 5. Nf3 O-O 6. O-O d6 7. Nc3 a5 $5 {
This game was played at the Cappelle la Grande tournament in France. My
opponent was a Russian GM. I have to admit that I was very annoyed with myself
after the game, because I felt that I had achieved a good position from the
opening. I then went on to throw it away. Never a pleasant feeling in chess!}
8. b3 {White will often choose this positional move which I now consider to be
the main line. The plan is to simply play Bb2 gaining extra control over e5.}
Ne4 {This is a common plan in this type of structure. As Black's position is
more cramped, exchanges tend to help him. It is also now possible for Black to
move his bishop to f6.} 9. Bb2 Nxc3 $5 {I believe that this is Black's best
chance. The general plan is to meet e4 with ...f4 when Black often has chances
to attack on the kingside.} ({I used to play} 9... Bf6 {on a regular basis but
I had some difficulty finding a good response to} 10. Qc2 Nxc3 11. Bxc3 {, for
example} Nc6 12. e4 $1 fxe4 13. Qxe4 {. --- BRAINSTORMING POINT! --- This type

had a dream position and went on to win in R.Ruck-S.Williams, European
under-20 Championship 1997.}) 10. Bxc3 Qe8 {The black queen wriggles its way
around to h5. White has a number of options here.} 11. Re1 {A very logical
move. The rook is well placed behind the e-pawn. One logical plan is e4-e5.}

position, but I soon got myself into trouble:} 12. e4 f4 13. d5 $1 cxd5 14. e5

POINT! --- Capturing on e4 would give White the type of position that he wants.
We have to avoid this at all costs and play a different plan. What should that
plan be?} f4 $1 {That's right! --- BRAINSTORMING POINT! --- From a positional
point of view, Black is forced to meet 12 e4 with 12...f4. If the e-file is
ever opened, Black will be positionally lost. Black must always aim to keep a
White pawn on the e-file. --- The move ...f4 gives Black good attacking
chances on the kingside. As you will see, the f-pawn will eventually become a
thorn in White's side.} (12... fxe4 $2 13. Rxe4 {Black must avoid this type of
structure! White will always have pressure against Black's pawn on e6. Black
is also left with a cramped and passive position. This was not the reason

to avoid playing ...d5 as the position then resembles a Stonewall Dutch rather

moves that they did not necessarily want to play. For example, Black has

played in the Stonewall Dutch. --- Let's take a look at how the game M.Kopstov-I.Naumkin, Moscow 2002, continued:} 10. Ne5 c6 11. f3 Nxc3 12. bxc3 Nd7

Black needs to know. The following point is extremely relevant here: If White
can achieve the e4 advance without Black playing ...e5 and Black has to

this position, the queen manoeuvre is often the most popular choice. Chess
legends such as Tal and Korchnoi used to play it with great success at the

participate in a kingside attack. Another idea behind this move is to vacate
the d8-square for either Black's knight or bishop. If Black can play ...Bd8,
then at a later stage, he may be able to play ...e5, taking control of the
centre. --- I have never had any luck with 7...Qe8 and I actually feel that it

obtain an advantage. --- 2) If Black can achieve the ...e5 advance, he will
have gained an equal position. --- This is the reason behind Black playing ...e5. The only problem with this move is that Black must sacrifice a pawn. Black

the Dutch is really an opening that requires Black to play as actively as

d6 7. Nc3 Ne4 $5 {. This is a logical move. White has a space advantage so
Black aims to alleviate his position by exchanging pieces with the move ...Ne4.
This move also frees the f6-square for Black's dark-squared bishop. I used to
think that this was the solution to all of Black's problems. That was until
White started to play 8 Nxe4! --- The latter is the only way that White can
aim to gain an advantage, but there is still not enough evidence to suggest
that the resulting position is equal or even slightly better for White. I
personally think that White has a very small advantage, but the position
remains unbalanced and is therefore extremely interesting. --- 7...Ne4 is an
easy line to remember and Black's future plans are relatively straightforward
compared with Black's other options on move eight. --- There is quite an
amusing story behind the first time that I ever played this line. I was at the
Reykjavik Open relaxing with some friends. If I recall correctly, I was in the
company of Ben Johnson (not the runner!), John Bick, Ylon Schwartz and Luis
Galego, a GM from Portugal. It was rather late at night, or more likely,
sometime in the early hours of the morning and I had just found out that I was
due to play Sokolov the following day with the black pieces. For those of you
who don't know, Ivan Sokolov is an extremely strong player with a rating of
around 2700. --- I had a deal with Ylon Schwartz that if I managed to beat
Sokolov with Black in the Classical Dutch then Ylon would have to play this
opening for the remainder of the tournament. At the time, we may have had a
couple of 'Viking' beers so it seemed like a good plan. --- The next day, I
played one of the best games in my life and I somehow managed to win
spectacularly. Ylon also won his game with the Dutch so the opening did quite
well! --- Imagine my surprise when the next time I came across Mr Schwartz was
when I turned on the television to watch the 2008 World Series of Poker. To my
shock, there was Ylon on the final table! How did this happen? At this stage
of the tournament, he was guaranteed at least two million dollars and I think
that he went on to finish in fourth place. A fantastic result and I am really
happy for him as he is a great guy and a fan of the Classical Dutch!} 8. -- *

{After my game against Sokolov, I couldn't wait to give the 7...Ne4 variation
another go, as I was feeling very confident about the opening. The perfect
opportunity then arose in the British League, where I found myself paired
against Shirov! He is actually one of my all-time favourite players due to his
style, which is both dynamic and exciting. When he played d4 on move one, my
hopes started to rise. Will he let me play 7...Ne4!? and can I beat another
great player in this variation!? --- Indeed, Shirov did let me play ...Ne4 and
again, I achieved a good position. Unfortunately, I played badly and failed to
convert my advantage but this was still a good result for the opening. ---

often the positions can become quite equal, meaning there is a high percentage
chance of a draw. --- BRAINSTORMING POINT! --- This capture is the critical
variation. In my opinion this is the move that White should be looking at

flexibly placed on d7 and depending on what White plays it can come out via e8

play based around b5, Rb8, Na5/Nb4 and even ...Bc6.} 14. e5 {White has a
number of other possibilities in this position. We will take a look at these
in the theory section.} Be8 $1 {This is a good move. It has two main goals: 1)
Increasing the pressure against White's d-pawn. Black can now play ...Qd7 and ...Rd8. --- 2) Black was weak on the b1-h7 diagonal and had to think of a way

some point. Moskalenko gives the move 9...a5 as dubious, but I have to
disagree with him on this point. He prefers 9...Bf6 but the move 10 b4 has
always scared me here. In my first book on the Dutch, Play the Classical Dutch,
I suggested the move 10...Nd7, but nowadays I prefer not to give my opponent
so much space on one area of the board. --- In my opinion, White's trickiest

what happens if White deviates at an early stage. This chapter will
concentrate on lines where White has already fianchettoed his kingside bishop.
If you play the Classical Dutch on a regular basis, you will certainly come
across these deviations at some point in your career. --- In this chapter we
take an in-depth look at an idea that has become very popular (at least
against me!) recently. That idea is White moving his knight to h3. I have
scored awfully against this plan in the last couple of years, so I have really
gone into some detail on an early Nh3 during this chapter. --- I thought that
the best way to get to grips with this idea was to go over a number of games
that have been played in this variation. Hopefully then you will feel
comfortable facing it. I would recommend that you study this chapter in full,
as a lot of the lines demonstrate the way that Black should be thinking when
playing the Dutch. --- This chapter will cover such lines as: 1) An early Nh3.

{I played this game at the Montpellier Open in 2003. This was a great
tournament as the town and beach had a lot to offer! --- My opponent, a strong
player, chose a line which had become increasingly popular over the years.
Luckily, I had looked at the line with my good friend Richard Pert before the
game. Richard had suggested a very interesting idea, an idea that he had
previously used against GM Glenn Flear. Well, the idea worked a treat! Let's
take a look.} 1. d4 e6 {I normally play this as I am happy to enter into a

this book! This is an interesting move order trick that also stops White from
playing b4, for example,} 7. Nc3 (7. b3 a4 $5 {is an interesting idea}) 7... d6
{and Black avoids the early b4 variations.}) 7. b4 $5 {This is a good plan.
White tries to grab some space on the queenside as well as suffocate Black on
the same side of the board.} Ne4 $1 {In previous games, we have seen that this
is a good square for Black's knight. The knight move also allows Black to play
...Bf6.} 8. Bb2 {A natural developing move.} ({Another possible idea was} 8. a4

gain some counterplay on the queenside.} 9. b5 (9. a3 {will be looked at later
on in this book.}) 9... a4 $5 {A very interesting idea. This is the move that
Richard Pert had previously played and analysed. There are two main points
behind this move: 1) Black wants to make it difficult for White to develop his
knight on b1. --- 2) Black stops White from playing a4 and in doing so, limits
White's defensive resources. Black can also aim to play ...c6 and ...cxb5,
which will weaken White's pawn on b5.} 10. Nfd2 {Naturally, White wants to
swap off Black's knight on e4.} d5 $1 {This is a rare example where I am happy
to play a Stonewall Dutch set-up. My main idea is to attack White's pawns on
c4 and b5. It is also hard for White to develop his queenside pieces.} 11. Nxe4
{By capturing this knight, White can move his other knight to d2.} fxe4 {
Recapturing towards the centre is the normal response.} 12. Ba3 c6 $1 {
BRAINSTORMING POINT! --- In this variation, Black often relies on this move to
try to destroy White's pawn formation on the queenside.} 13. f3 $2 {This is a
typical move that White plays once he has captured on e4, but in this position,
the move is not so strong because I will win a pawn and gain the initiative.}

{This next game was played at the Hastings International Chess Congress in
2009. Hastings is the longest running tournament in the history of chess and I
have regularly competed in the congress since the age of twelve. The
tournament starts just after Christmas and Hastings itself is normally very
wet and windy, but there is warmth to be found in "The Pig in Paradise", which
is a friendly pub, where I have analysed a large number of games. --- White's
opening choice in this game is quite popular. Let's take a look.} 1. d4 e6 2.
c4 f5 3. g3 Nf6 4. Bg2 Be7 5. Nc3 O-O {BRAINSTORMING POINT! --- Black always
has to be careful in the opening as White has a number of move order tricks.
If Black continues to move in stereotypical fashion, then he can easily reach
a bad position. In other words, do not rush the opening and always be aware of
White's options.} 6. Nh3 {This has been a very popular choice since it was
recommended as an answer to the Stonewall Dutch. If Black continues with the
pawn push ...d5, then the knight on h3 will be well placed, but of course
Black does not have to play d5 here. In actual fact, if Black can play ...d6
and ...e5 then White's knight on h3 can become quite stupid. --- Let's just
see what happens in the game.} (6. e4 $6 {is now pointless as Black can play}
fxe4 7. Nxe4 d5 $1 {with a good position. More on this move later.}) 6... d6 $1
7. O-O $6 {This is the wrong plan, after which Black gains a perfectly
respectable position.} ({Later on, Greek GM Halkias played the much more
dangerous idea of} 7. Nf4 $1 {against me. This move will be looked at in the
last introductory game of this chapter.}) 7... e5 {This standard Dutch move
appears to be stronger in this position due to the fact that White's knight on
h3 is misplaced. The knight really wants to move to f4 but this is not
possible.} (7... c6 {is another sensible move. Black gains control of d5
before playing ...e5.}) 8. dxe5 {White goes for a queen exchange but this move
does not improve White's position.} dxe5 {Black is at least equal.} 9. Qxd8
Bxd8 $1 {In the majority of cases, this is the best way for Black to recapture
the queen. There are two main reasons why this is the correct move: 1) White
would like to play Nd5 which attacks the e7-square. Therefore, Black saves a
tempo by capturing on d8 with the bishop. --- 2) Black wants to play ...c6 and
then ...Bb6. If White eventually plays e4 then Black's bishop will be
excellently placed on d4, as it cannot be kicked away from this square. The
a7-g1 diagonal is better than the f8-a3 diagonal!} 10. Ng5 {In the next
introductory game, we will look at another option for White. --- White has to
waste time in order to bring this knight back into the game.} ({Other moves
would allow me to play ...h6, when the knight is stuck on h3, for example,} 10.
b3 h6 $5 11. Ba3 Re8 {looks good for Black.}) 10... c6 {This move controls d5
and allows me to play ...Bb6 or maybe ...Ba5. I think that Black is slightly
better here.} 11. b3 {BRAINSTORMING POINT! --- White wants to play Ba3 and Nf3.
How can I try and stop White from doing this?} e4 $1 {Taking control of f3.
White's knight is now cut off.} 12. h4 ({White had to play this move otherwise
I would have played ...h6 and ...g5, when White's knight is permanently
stranded, for example,} 12. Rd1 h6 13. Nh3 g5 {.}) 12... Na6 {It is time to
develop!} 13. Bf4 h6 {This move looks fine for Black. White's knight really
wants to move to f4 but now this plan will take a lot longer.} 14. Nh3 Be6 {
White's bishop on g2 and knight on h3 are very badly placed. The only way that
White can activate them is to play f3. As a result, I should try and stop this
move at all costs or, if I cannot prevent it, then I should at least aim to
make this move less effective.} 15. Rfd1 Ba5 {This gains a tempo and I can now
contest the d-file.} 16. Rac1 Rad8 17. Na4 Bb4 {It is a good idea to stop a3
and Bd6.} 18. Be5 Ng4 19. Bd4 c5 20. Bb2 {BRAINSTORMING POINT! --- White is

around stopping White's knight on h3 from ever finding a good square. How can
Black prevent Nf4?} Bd2 $1 21. Ra1 (21. Rc2 $6 {is the move that White wants

move. White must exchange my active bishop on d2.} (22. Nf4 $2 Bxf4 23. gxf4 {
leaves White with a horrible pawn formation on the kingside. The bishop on g2
also plays no part in the game.}) 22... Bxc3 23. Nxc3 e3 $5 {This is an
interesting way of troubling White's kingside. On the downside, I am setting
free White's light-squared bishop.} 24. f3 Nf6 {This square is preferable to
e5, as I need to cover the d5-square with as many pieces as possible. I really
have to stop White from cementing a piece on d5.} 25. Nf4 {White's knight has

entering the game. Without these two pieces, White will find it hard to ever
claim any advantage.} 0-1

{This game should have been an important moment in the development of my Dutch
Defence career. My opponent found a rather old, yet interesting idea that I
fell straight into. I went on to lose an important game, in an important team
event. --- I made a typical mistake after the game, instead of analysing my
errors, I headed straight to the bar, pushing the game into the recesses of
the mind. This meant that I lost again in similar circumstances, in future
events. One simple bit of advice: always analyse your losses! --- In my
defence, it was Christmas Day!} 1. d4 e6 2. g3 f5 3. Bg2 Nf6 4. c4 (4. Nh3 {

saw this idea being used - I came across it in Bellin's excellent book,
'Winning with the Dutch'. Any idea by Karpov is an idea worthy of
investigation. --- It is funny that 20 years on, I had a chance to talk to
Nigel about this game. It was just after I had lost to Halkias in the World
Cities Championship (see game above - Christmas Day!) and Nigel was my team
mate on the London team (strange as most of our team had little or no ties to
London). Halkias had used the same plan of Nh3 against me in a successful
manner. --- Nigel gave me the impression that this plan of Nh3 was well known
and a reason that he had stopped playing the Dutch. He was very dismissive of
Black's opening. Fair enough, but I was more disappointed to see him write
some negative things about my play in a later copy of New in Chess.} Be7 5. O-O
O-O {Of course Black can play into a Stonewall Dutch set-up at any moment, but
then the move Nh3 fits in very well with White's strategy. White will simply
want to continue with Nf4, Nd3, Nd2 and Nf3, when both white knights take
control of the e5-square.} 6. c4 d6 7. Nc3 $6 {In my opinion this is slightly
dubious as it allows Black the chance to play ...e5 with a good position.} (7.

it had been tried at top level, and Karpov practically refutes it.} (8... Nc6 {

playing Nh3. As you can see in the games here, I have a terrible record

it will directly attack the e5-square. This move makes more sense compared to

now.} ({David Eggleston demonstrated a much better plan in his game against

good enough plan for equality.} (7... e4 {looks logical, but I always try to

{In this game David Eggleston, playing Black, finds a good way to play against
an early Nh3. I suggest that you follow David's example here, I certainly will
in the future. The basic idea is to try and force through the e5 break. As
long as you remember to do this, then you should get a good position. Black
should set up this idea in one of two ways, depending on the situation: 1) The
way shown in this game: ...Qe8-Bd8-Nbd7 and finally ...e5. --- 2) ...c6-Qc7-e5.

ideas of swinging out to h5, but more importantly, from e8 the queen helps
prepare the ...e5 advance.} (7... c6 {is another good plan. After} 8. O-O {

attack on the kingside. For example,} h6 {. (a useful move to play, stopping
White from ever moving the knight on h3 into g5)} 11. Qc2 c6 $1 {(this is the

{This game was played in the last round of the 2012 Malta Open. I went to the
event in a bit of a holiday mood, and I was joined in Malta by a number of
chess-playing friends from England. There were a number of interesting moments.
One that springs to mind was a large bet that I managed to win. --- What did I
have to do? Well during a meal at a rather posh local restaurant, I had to
suddenly strip off and swim across the ocean to the other side of the harbour.
I must now apologise to everyone else at the restaurant who must have surely
been put off by this rather peculiar sight. Such a sensible tournament... ---
As this was the last round, a couple of us decided to drink a little bit of
Sangria before the game. Obviously this is not to be recommended, but it
certainly seemed to put me in a good mood for the match... --- Some very
thematic Dutch ideas are demonstrated in this game. Let's see what those ideas
are.} 1. d4 e6 2. Nf3 f5 3. g3 Nf6 4. Bg2 Be7 5. O-O O-O 6. b3 {This is a very
sensible move. White prepares to develop his bishop to the natural b2-square.
I now continued with a standard idea.} Ne4 {There is no need to play ...d6
quite yet. In some cases I may have even played ...d5 instead, depending on
how my opponent continued.} 7. c4 Bf6 {I favour this set up of knight on e4
and bishop on f6. It maximises the potential of both pieces.} ({Another
typical plan would have been} 7... a5 {. This is similar in spirit to my game
against Gelfand. The a-pawn can cause a number of problems in White's position.
}) 8. Bb2 d6 {We have now transposed back into one of the main lines with an
early b3.} 9. Nc3 Nc6 {The black knight can safely develop to c6 as Black no
longer has to fear the pawn advance d5.} 10. e3 {Now that White has
over-protected his d4 pawn, White might be intending to continue with Nxe4.
For that reason I decided to capture on c3 first.} (10. Nxe4 {is nothing to
worry about, as after} fxe4 {the white knight on f3 does not have a good
square to retreat to.}) 10... Nxc3 11. Bxc3 Qe7 {I wanted to keep the queens
on the board. This might have been due to the after-effects of a jug of
Sangria.} ({Another sensible choice that leads to an equal position would have
been} 11... e5 12. dxe5 dxe5 13. Qd5+ Kh8 14. Qxd8 Rxd8 15. Rfd1 e4 $1 {with
equality.}) 12. b4 $1 {Very logical. White should gain some space on the
queenside.} e5 13. b5 (13. dxe5 dxe5 14. b5 Nd8 15. e4 {when} Nf7 $5 {is
possible,} ({but I was planning a typical idea:} 15... f4 {which leads to a
very murky position after} 16. gxf4 exf4 17. e5 Bg5 18. Nxg5 Qxg5 19. Kh1 {.}))
13... Nd8 14. Qb3 $6 {This is what I call an 'autopilot' move. It looks
sensible and cannot be a major mistake, but it also does little to stop
Black's build- up in the centre and kingside. White should have probably
captured on e5, opening up the d-file. This is often the best way for White to
react to ...e5.} (14. dxe5 dxe5 {leads to the variation given above.}) 14... e4
$1 {This is the start of a plan which I would advise you all to remember. In
this game it works to perfection. --- 1) Play ...e4, gaining some space on the
kingside. --- 2) Play ...g5-g4. This gains more space, but most importantly,
once my pawn gets to g4 White won't be able to break out with f3. This is the
one move that Black wants to stop. If Black stops f3, White's bishop on g2
becomes an awful piece. --- 3) Prepare an attack on the kingside. --- 4) Bring
my knight on d8 to g5 via f7. With a pawn on g5 and knight on g4, Black will
always have a very dangerous threat of ...Nf3+. --- 5) Open the h-file and
attack on the h-file. This can be done with ...h5-h4, ...Kg7, ...Rh8. --- 6)
Try to stop or hold up White's counterplay on the queenside. --- As we will
see, in the game this plan worked perfectly!} 15. Nd2 g5 $1 {Stage 2 of the
plan in action, rush a pawn to g4. The most important thing for me to remember
at this moment, was White playing f3. At the time I had assumed that I would
win a pawn after f3, but things are not so clear.} 16. Bb4 $2 {Another lax
move that does little to stop my plan of attack on the kingside.} (16. f3 $1 {
was most worrying. This idea makes perfect sense, as Black has exposed his own
king with the move ...g5, so White should aim to open up the whole position in
order to attack the black king. After} exf3 17. Rxf3 g4 18. Rf2 Qxe3 {I do win
a pawn but White gains a lot of counterplay. For example,} 19. Nf1 Qg5 20. Re1
{and I would prefer to be White in this position.}) 16... g4 $1 {Now that the
kingside is locked I can look to the future with confidence.} 17. c5+ Be6 18.
cxd6 cxd6 19. Qa3 Nf7 {Stage 3 of my plan in motion. Eventually this knight
will move into the f3-square. Black is clearly better now.} 20. Rfc1 a5 {I
must remember also to keep an eye on the queenside. There is no need for me to
throw everything at White's king, not yet anyway, the attack will come with
time.} 21. bxa6 Rxa6 22. Qb2 Bd5 23. a3 h5 {Here comes stage 5 of my plan!
Once the h-file is open, White's king will be very weak.} 24. Rc2 ({White
should have played} 24. Bf1 {. This does take a defender away from the white
king, but White also needs to try and create counterplay on the queenside.})
24... h4 25. Rac1 Rc6 {Let's not forget about stage 6 of my plan. I must also
keep an eye on White's queenside play and aim to slow it down.} 26. Rxc6 bxc6 {
It is strange that even here the computer believes that this position is equal,
whilst it looks winning for Black to me.} 27. Nc4 Rb8 {Threatening ...c5
winning a piece.} 28. Qc2 Qe6 29. Na5 Kg7 $1 {Stage 5! At some point I will
move my rook to h8. There is no rush, though. White is powerless to stop my
attack.} 30. Nc4 Be7 ({Missing a tactic:} 30... c5 $1 {would have won on the
spot. For example,} 31. dxc5 dxc5 32. Bxc5 Bxc4 33. Qxc4 Qxc4 34. Rxc4 Rb1+ 35.
Bf1 Ne5 36. Rc2 Nf3+ 37. Kg2 h3+ 38. Kh1 Rxf1# {.}) 31. gxh4 {Desperation, but
things were already grim for White.} Bxh4 32. h3 gxh3 33. Bh1 (33. Bxh3 {and
now my knight finally reaches the g5-square:} Ng5 34. Bg2 Nf3+ 35. Bxf3 exf3
36. Kf1 Qg6 {. Black has a winning attack.}) 33... Be7 {Defending d6 so that ...Ng5 and ...Nf3 comes into the equation. There were other ways to win, but I
was set on my plan of manoeuvring my knight to f3.} 34. Nd2 h2+ 35. Kxh2 Qg6 {
...Rh8# is one nasty idea. White's king is helpless, and the rest of the game
plays itself.} 36. Bg2 Ng5 37. Kh1 Rh8+ (37... Nf3 {was even quicker but I was
enjoying myself too much.}) 38. Kg1 Rh4 39. a4 Ne6 {. A plan rarely succeeds
so well in a game of chess, especially against such a highly-rated opponent.}

{BRAINSTORMING POINT! --- Before we take a deeper look at the theory of Nh3 I
would just like to make some observations that you should bear in mind. --- 1)
There are various different move orders that White can use in this system. You
must always stay on the lookout for what White is actually playing. It is very
easy in the opening to go into 'auto-pilot'. This is nearly always a big
mistake, but I have found it especially so in the Classical Dutch. Most move
orders are covered here or in the introductory games. --- 2) You must try to
avoid allowing the trick that I fell into in my game against Halkias. That
trick is the sequence Nf4 e5; dxe5 dxe5; Qxd8 Bxd8; Ne6! Always be on the
lookout for Ne6 after ...e5. --- 3) If White delays playing Nf4 but instead
develops with Nc3?!, it is nearly always a good idea to advance with ...e5!,
keeping the white knight stuck out of the game on h3. --- 4) If White plays an
early b3 and Nf4 without Nc3 then you must choose between playing one of the
following plans: a) ...c6, ...Qc7 and ...e5. --- b) ...Qe8, ...Bd8, ...Nbd7
and ...e5. --- c) A combination of both of the above plans. --- As you will
see in the first line below, Black gains a good position by playing ...c6 and
then ...Nbd7 with the idea of going ...e5 next. --- It really depends on the
situation as to what is the correct plan, but if you at least know what plans
you should be thinking of, it will no doubt help you play the right one! ---
As long as you follow these pointers then you should get a good position.} 1.
d4 f5 2. g3 e6 3. Bg2 Nf6 4. c4 Be7 5. Nh3 {is normally aimed against the
Stonewall Dutch set-up. In that set-up, with black pawns on c6, d5, e6 and f5,
White aims to take complete control of the weak e5-square. White does this by
playing Nf4-Nd3 and with the other knight Nd2-Nf3. --- Black has not played ...d5 yet, so it should be in his favour to play ...d6 and ...e5, limiting the
activity of White's knight on h3 and taking control of the e5-square.} O-O 6.

9... Bxd8 $1 {. This move is superior to 9...Rxd8 for two main reasons: 1)
White would like to play Nd5, which attacks the e7-square. Therefore Black
saves a tempo by capturing on d8 with the bishop. --- 2) Black wants to play ...c6 and then ...Bb6. If White eventually plays e4, then Black's bishop will be
excellent on d4 as it cannot be kicked away from this square. --- The a7-g1

idea is not seen that often at grandmaster level because... --- BRAINSTORMING
POINT! --- 1) Black is able to fianchetto his light-squared bishop with ...b6

the pawn structure. --- Black still has to find a way to exploit this, though.
White normally continues with f3, Bd3 and Nge2 creating a solid set-up. --- As
a general rule, Black should play ...Bb4, as White cannot meet this move with

1. d4 e6 {I often choose this move order as I am happy to play the French
Defence and this move also avoids early deviations that can arise after 1 d4
f5, for example, 2 Nc3 or 2 Bg5. These deviations will be covered in the next
section of this book.} 2. c4 f5 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Qc2 {White has a large range of
different move orders to choose from if he decides not to fianchetto. Black
must remain alert at all times to White's objectives. For example, in this
position it should be pretty obvious that White intends to play an early e4.
How should Black stop this advance?} Bb4 $1 {This is a perfectly sensible
response. --- BRAINSTORMING POINT! --- When White avoids fianchettoing, the
game will often revolve around the important e4-square. Both sides aim to gain
control of this square with as many pieces as possible, hence the reason why ...Bb4 is a good idea. The bishop is rarely well placed on e7 when White chooses
not to fianchetto.} 5. e3 {BRAINSTORMING POINT! --- After this move, it should
be obvious that White has no intention of playing g3 and Bg2. What plan should
Black put into motion? It is a plan that is rarely playable when White
fianchettoes.} b6 $1 {Black's light-squared bishop is well placed on b7.
Therefore, this plan is worth bearing in mind. --- BRAINSTORMING POINT! --- If
White avoids fianchettoing kingside then Black should aim to fianchetto
queenside.} 6. Bd3 Bb7 7. f3 $1 {This is the most sensible plan. White should
really stop a black piece from landing on e4.} c5 {This is another typical
plan. Black strikes out on the dark squares. I was aiming to finish my
development by playing ...d6 and ...Nbd7 when all of my pieces are working in
harmony.} 8. a3 $6 {I am not too keen on this move as there is no real rush to
play it. White should have played Nge2 first so that he has the option of
recapturing on c3 with the knight.} Bxc3+ 9. Qxc3 Nh5 $5 {BRAINSTORMING POINT!
--- This is another typical plan. White has weakened the e1-h4 diagonal so I
take advantage of this by starting an immediate attack. It is worth noting
that if White's queen was still on c2 then this attack would be irrelevant as
Qf2 would be possible.} 10. Nh3 {The knight is poorly placed on f2.} ({Another

currently have two pieces pointing towards the white king. With my next move,
I brought another piece around. What did I play?} Rf6 $1 {A good idea, more

{This is a very important section as both the Colle and the London systems are
extremely popular at club level. I can guarantee that at some point during
your Classical Dutch playing career, you will face at least one of these
systems. To my knowledge, there is no literature available that shows how
exponents of the Classical Dutch should play against such systems. With this
in mind, I have spent some time looking for an aggressive set-up. My findings
are documented in this chapter:} 1. -- {The Colle System is an opening where
White adopts the same set-up against any black defence. White will often play
1 d4, 2 Nf3, 3 e3, 4 Bd3, 5 0-0 etc. This system is less effective against the

popular at club level because they are relatively easy to learn and can be

work well against a player who is well prepared in the Classical Dutch! ---
BRAINSTORMING POINT! --- 1) Against the Colle System (where White leaves his
bishop on c1), Black should develop his light-squared bishop to b7 in order to
gain more control of the e4-square. --- 2) Against the London System (where
White develops his bishop to f4), Black should leave his light-squared bishop
on c8 and instead concentrate on playing the e5 advance. --- We are going to
concentrate mainly on the London System as I believe that this is the biggest
threat to the Dutch. Just take a look at White's dark-squared bishop in both
of the diagrams above to understand my reasoning! (On the other hand, this
bishop can become a target for the move ...e5! More on this later...) ---

{Key Points: White's Strategies --- a) The power of White's dark-squared
bishop: White often relies on the power of his dark-squared bishop to place
pressure against the d6- and c7-squares. This is particularly true when Black
plays a set-up with ...b6 and ...Bb7. I am not going to recommend this system
for Black, but instead concentrate on a set-up where Black aims to play an
early ...e5!. --- Let's have a look at the following game to see an example of
how powerful White's dark-squared bishop can become. --- This position was
reached in the game B.Grachev-A.Morozevich, Tal Memorial Blitz 2008. In this
position, White now played the typical break...} 11. c5 $1 {An aggressive move.
Play now continued} Ne4 12. cxd6 cxd6 13. Nd2 Nc8 14. Rc1 {, when White had
all the pressure. --- I actually believe that Black's plan of playing ...b6
and ...Bb7 was too slow. I prefer a set-up where Black aims for a quick ...e5!.

{1) Against the London System, Black should play ...g6 and ...Bg7! --- I
really like this strategy when White plays an early Bf4 for the following
reasons: a) The bishop on g7 supports the ...e5 advance. The bishop also has
more potential on g7 compared to e7. --- b) The pawn on g6 gives extra support
to Black's pawn on f5, so when ...e5 is eventually played, f5 will become more
secure. --- Let's take a look at an example of when Black plays ...g6. ---

going to suggest that Black does not waste time playing ...b6 and ...Bb7 but

I believe the best way to play against the London System and the Colle system
is the following: 1) If White plays 4 e3, Black should reply with 4...g6,
followed by ...Bg7, ...d6, ...Qe7, ...Nc6 and then ...e5!. --- 2) If White
plays 4 c3, Black can often do without ...g6 and should instead play 4...d6
with the idea of playing ...Nc6 ...Qe7 and then ...e5!. --- The reason I
suggest that Black should play ...g6 against e3, rather than the immediate ...d6, is because this move can sometimes run into a Bc4 idea, when the a2-g8
diagonal can be a thorn in Black's side. --- After the move 4 c3 has been
played, it takes more time for White to position a bishop on the a2-g8
diagonal so it is now safe for Black to play the immediate ...d6!.}) *

{I do not think highly of this variation. For this reason, I am only going to
briefly look at some of the ideas. In my experience, most players playing with
the white pieces will always prefer to develop their dark-squared bishop
outside the pawn chain and for good reason. After 3 e3, the only way that
White can develop his dark-squared bishop is to play b3. On the other hand,
Black develops his light-squared bishop to b7, gaining more control of the
e4-square.} 1. -- {Let's take a look at how Black should play this position

{2...h6 3 Bh4 g5 4 e4 Rh7!?!? is a very risky move but as it is so interesting
and complicated, I thought that it needed to be included in this chapter. If
you want to play without any risk then you should play 2 Bg5 Nf6 3 Bxf6 exf6
followed by ...d5 and Black has a solid position. --- In order to get to grips
with this position, I would suggest that you take a look at some of the top
Grandmaster games in this line. As this line is not so theoretical, the player
who has a greater understanding of the middlegame will often be triumphant.} 1.

solid. Let's take a look at two examples of this.} 3. -- (3. Bxf6 {is the most

{To play ...e6 or ...e5? --- The main position that we are going to look at in
this chapter arises after the following starting moves:} 1. c4 f5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3.
g3 e6 4. Bg2 Be7 5. d3 O-O {. It is worth noting that this position can be
reached via several different move orders. --- This is a fairly popular
approach among club players. The English Opening is an easy system to learn,
where White will often play the first eight moves or so without much thought.
--- I have always found that the Dutch works rather well against the English
set-up and my own results on the black side of this opening have been very
good. The position resembles that of a reversed Grand Prix Attack, where Black
aims to attack on the kingside whilst White focuses his attention on the
queenside. --- BRAINSTORMING POINT! --- The first thing to bear in mind when
playing against the English set-up is whether or not you can achieve the ...e5
advance in one move, i.e. not waste time by playing ...e6 followed by ...e5 at
a later stage. I am not going to dwell on this too much, but ideally Black
would like to play ...e5 as early as possible. --- In general, I will play ...e5 if I believe that my opponent won't respond with a quick d4 which is, to my
mind, the best response to ...e5. This will often be the case when playing
against the average 1 c4 player as they are usually happy to just play with
the same set-up.} *

POINT! --- In the English, the starting move order is more important than in
any other set-up against the Dutch. Proceed carefully in the opening and
always consider whether it is worth playing ...e5 in one move or not. For
example, if your opponent plays d3 very early on, it is worth responding with ...e5, as he is less likely to then play d4. --- Nevertheless, in this chapter,
I will mainly concentrate on a set-up where Black plays an early ...e6. I am
not suggesting that this is the best move but I do have some interesting ideas
and tricks for Black.} *

{Let's now take a look at what both sides are trying to achieve in the
following position:} 1. -- (1. -- {White's Strategy: After 5 d3, White is no
longer trying to stop Black from playing the typical ...e5 advance. Instead,
White will aim to play around this move. This is normally achieved in two
different ways: 1) White plays e4. Club players will often play this move
without too much thought. The main reason for this is due to an excellent book
that GM Tony Kosten wrote on the English. In this book, Tony recommended a
set-up based on e4 known as the Botvinnik System. --- I have a specific line
that I enjoy playing against this set-up. This is one of the main reasons why
I avoid playing ...d6 too early. My plan is to develop my dark-squared bishop
to either b4 or c5, a plan that is not possible with a pawn on d6. --- 2)
White decides to concentrate his play on the queenside by playing moves like
Rb1, b4, b5 etc. This can lead to an interesting battle where Black attacks on
the kingside and White attacks on the queenside. --- Personally, I believe
that White's best set-up is one based on e3 and Nge2. These two moves prevent
Black from attacking on the kingside. Black will often rely on the move ...f4
to start an attack and by playing e3 and Nge2, White takes control of this
critical square.}) (1. -- {Black's Strategy: Black's strategy can be
summarised in a few points and is playable against both of White's set-ups
mentioned above. --- 1) Play ...e5. This critical move shows its face again!
You can sometimes wait before playing this advance in order to keep some
flexibility with regard to the placement of the dark-squared bishop. This is
especially true when White adopts plan '1' mentioned above, but eventually you
should always aim to advance with ...e5. --- 2) Develop the knight to c6.
Black no longer has to worry about White playing d5 so ...Nc6 makes a lot more
sense. Black can often meet the b4-b5 advance with ...Qe8 and ...Nd8. In a
number of my games, I have managed to follow up with ...g5, ...g4, ...Nf7 and ...Ng5 and my pieces are all positioned around White's king! --- 3) Play the
typical manoeuvre ...Qe8 and ...Qh5 in order to place more pressure on White's
kingside. --- 4) Advance on the kingside with ...g5 and ...g4. --- Black can
always consider playing ...c6 as well, but this move does have its advantages
and disadvantages. On the plus side, Black can then play ...Qe8 ...Bd8 and
either ...Bb6 or ...Bc7, when the dark-squared bishop finds a new lease of
life.}) *

{IM Robert Bellin is a 'Jedi Master' of the Dutch, there is no doubt about it!
One of Bellin's first books, entitled, 'Winning with the Dutch' actually
inspired me to play the Classical Dutch. Robert has played the Dutch for most
of his life so it is well worth taking a look at his games in this opening.
--- This next game is very interesting. Robert followed GM Magnus Carlsen's
idea by playing an early d3. However my response, which is rather rare, looks
perfectly satisfactory and also leads to some very exciting positions.} 1. Nf3
f5 2. d3 $5 {This is an interesting idea that has been used by Carlsen. White
aims to disrupt Black's position by playing an early e4. Luckily, I have an
idea against this plan.} d6 {Black aims to meet e4 with ...e5. I have
previously written about this in my first book, 'Play the Classical Dutch'.} 3.
e4 e5 4. Nc3 c5 $5 {An interesting idea. Black establishes a strong centre and
most importantly, I take control of the d4-square. Nonetheless, there are
downsides to this plan such as my lack of development and my weaknesses on the
light squares, especially f5 and d5.} 5. g3 Be7 $5 {Played in order to stop
Nh4, a move that would immediately put pressure on my f5-pawn.} ({In the
theory section, we will concentrate on the very interesting} 5... Nc6 $5 {.})
6. Bh3 $1 {A good move as White targets the light squares. Any other move
would have left me with a comfortable game.} g6 7. exf5 {I had seen this move
coming and I was worried about 7...gxf5 8 Nh4! which looks very dangerous for
Black. Instead, I had another idea in mind...} h5 $5 {This stops White from
playing Qh5+ at a later stage. As some of you may be aware, I am rather fond
of pushing my h-pawn and I rarely get a chance to do this in the Dutch. After
just seven moves, we have reached a bizarre position.} 8. Bg2 $2 {This is a
bad move.} ({White has a couple of good options:} 8. Nd5 $1 {when he can claim
an advantage.}) (8. Nh4 $1 {will be looked at in the next game. --- In the

on.}) 8... gxf5 9. Bd2 $2 {This is too passive. Black has a space advantage
but has fallen behind in development.} ({White should have played} 9. h4 {as
this move takes control of the g5-square.}) 9... Nc6 10. Qe2 Be6 11. h4 Nf6 12.
Ng5 Bg8 {Black keeps control of the d5-square.} 13. f4 {At this moment, I was
feeling very happy with my position. White's king looks to be in some danger
and my knights are about to move onto some great squares.} Nd4 14. Qd1 Ng4 $1
15. Nd5 {A peculiar position. Just take a look at the knights! I will soon
exchange my bishops for White's knights which are clearly stronger. I also had
a cunning idea in mind...} e4 $1 {This move opens the lines towards White's
king.} 16. dxe4 Bxg5 17. hxg5 Bxd5 18. exd5 {A critical position. 18...Qe7+
looks like the obvious choice but is there a better move?} Qb6 $1 {I have to
make it difficult for White to castle and this move does just that. I expect
that I am now winning.} 19. c3 ({In response to} 19. O-O {, I would have played
} c4 {as I had seen the following attractive line:} 20. Re1+ Ne2+ {leading to
a winning position for Black.}) 19... O-O-O $1 20. cxd4 {The attack plays
itself.} Rde8+ 21. Kf1 Qb5+ 22. Kg1 {I was originally planning to play 22...Qd3 in this position but I could not find a win after 23 Be1. Subsequently, I
found an easier option.} Qxb2 $1 {Threatening ...Qxd4 and ...Qf2#. White has
only one way to stop this.} 23. Be1 Re2 24. Bf3 {A unique winning move now
appeared...} Rh2 $1 {. I am now threatening ...Rxh1, ...Qh2+ and then ...Ne3#.
White cannot stop all of the threats, so Robert resigned. I was obviously very
happy with this game as it felt good to checkmate an expert in the Dutch in
under twenty-five moves!} 0-1

can be very dangerous if Black is unprepared. I am going to recommend a plan
where Black returns the pawn in order to gain the initiative.} fxe4 3. Ng5 {As
mentioned earlier, this opening is similar to the From Gambit (1 f4 e5 2 fxe5
d6). White is planning to play d3 and if Black captures the pawn then White
can obtain the initiative. Therefore, I would suggest that Black does not
capture on d3 but instead plays:} Nc6 $5 {This rarely-played move seems to be
Black's simplest route to equality. It avoids a number of tricks and Black
aims to gain a big centre. I prefer this move to ...Nf6, as Black can often
attack the white knight on g5 by playing ...Be7. This move would not be
possible with a knight on f6.} 4. d3 e3 $1 {This is one of the main points
behind Black's opening play. Black returns the pawn but stops White's
light-squared bishop from reaching the aggressive d3-square. In addition,
Black will continue with ...e5, gaining space in the centre.} 5. Bxe3 e5 {Play
has transposed to a variation that White can obtain after 3...e5 but by
playing 3...Nc6, Black has limited White's options. In this position, White
can choose from the following moves:} 6. -- (6. f4 {This move is just a bit
too wild! Black needs to keep his calm and concentrate on the centre. For

Black puts extra pressure on White's knight on g5.} ({You could also consider
playing} 6... Nf6 {, but 6...Be7 looks more precise}) 7. Bg2 $1 {White does
not need to protect the knight on g5. I have found one example of this move

{Where do you go from here?} 1. -- (1. -- {Providing that you have studied
most of the material in this book, you are now ready to start playing the
Classical Dutch! --- Welcome to its mad world. The opening needs more
followers and like me, I hope that you have taken a shine to it. --- In the
past, when learning a new opening, I have often had trouble getting to grips
with the middlegame plans. From experience, I have found that a good way to
improve after studying an opening book/DVD is to look at the games of the
experts in that variation. You will often pick up tips and ideas along the way.
--- For this reason, I have included a list of players who are considered to
be "Jedi Masters" of the Classical Dutch. You can search for the games of
these players in any chess database. --- Throughout this book, you may have
noticed that I have used a large number of my own games. This is not because I
consider myself to be the greatest Dutch Jedi around but instead for the
reason that I understand my own thought processes better than anyone. --- In
my progression as a Classical Dutch player, I have often had to stand on my
own two feet or use trial and error to discover the best variations out there.
This has really helped me think in an original way, but it has also been quite
hard work! Luckily, I have already "tested the water" so you can now progress
without too much trouble. --- Anyway, let's move on to some other chess
players who are known to be avid followers of the Dutch, especially the
Classical Dutch. It is worth noting that I have chosen more modern players. If
you are interested, you can always look at the history section of this book
for a list of 'chess legends' that have tried their hand at the Dutch.}) (1. --
{Igor Naumkin: During my research, this gentleman's name kept cropping up. A
number of his games have greatly contributed to the progression of the Dutch.
--- Robert Bellin: Robert wrote one of the first books that ever dealt with
the Classical Dutch. This man has been a mover and shaker with this opening
for years. --- Thomas Rendle: A young English International Master who is an
expert in the Leningrad Dutch. Thomas has found great ways to play against
'Anti-Dutch' lines and I have learnt quite a lot from him by following his
encounters in the Dutch. --- Nigel Short: Nigel used the Dutch regularly in
his younger years. Will he return? --- Anatoly Vaisser: Anatoly has had some
great victories using the Dutch Defence. --- Vladimir Malaniuk: A very strong
Grandmaster whose games have featured in this book. --- Igor Glek: Another
ex-2600+ Grandmaster who used to score very well with the opening. ---
Alexandre Dgebuadze: Some of Alexandre's games have also featured in this book.
Alexandre seems to have a very good understanding of when he should play ...e5!
}) (1. -- {The above mentioned list should suffice for now. One of the most
interesting things to look at is the different ways in which these players
choose to tackle the opening. For example, it seems that Igor Glek always
likes to play ...c6 in the Classical Dutch, something that I do not really
touch upon. On the other hand, Nigel Short plays in a very flexible way by
combining ...Nc6 and ...d5 together. In comparison, I would say that I have
quite a distinct way of playing the opening as the move ...e5 always pops into
my head... --- With regard to your progression as a Classical Dutch specialist,
all of the above mentioned players have a lot to offer so it is worth studying
their games.}) *
